title : "Web Design"

This is a place I am going to post up all of my web design work I have done. It's small for now, but I hope it grows into a nice little portfolio of design. I may add some tutorials and other resources as I go along.

<ul>
<li><a href="http://amynrussell.com" title="Amy N. Russell's Website (External Link)" rel="external">Amy N. Russell</a>
I designed and coded my sister's entire site, except for the blog code integrated into it.</li>
<li><a href="http://justintadlock.com/archives/2007/02/25/make-your-myspace-profile-look-like-facebook" title="Make Your MySpace Profile Look Like Facebook">Facebook Mimic: MySpace Theme</a>
A MySpace theme based off the social network Facebook.  I enjoyed doing this, except for sludging through MySpace's code from the 1800s, but I managed.</li>
<li><a href="/warehouse/web-design/lane-and-kent" title="Lane & Kent Design">Lane & Kent</a>
A layout I made for <a href="http://laneandkent.foreverclois.com" title="Forever Clois" rel="external"> Forever Clois</a>.</li>
<li><a href="web-design/counter" title="Site Hit Counter">PHP Hit Counter</a>
A basic PHP hit counter do display on your site. Only a few lines of code, and nothing to modify.</li>
</ul>
