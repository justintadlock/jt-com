&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes I ask myself why,
I come to you at night.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To tell you my hopes and dreams,
The things that happen and how they seem.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My life sometimes may become a blur,
The emotions inside begin to stir.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At times I write to you for hours on end,
When I need to let my heart unbend.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The time when I was last heartbroken,
Sadness spread throughout; Unheard; Unspoken.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like lilies afloat a lake on a summer mornin',
You give me joy again and again.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the end of the day,
I must set you in your place.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then go off once more to dream my dreams,
To fill my future with things unseen.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Till I write tomorrow,
Please remember, you hold all my joy; pain; and sorrow.
