Feel free to contact me through this page.  I'll get back to you if I can, which could honestly be more than a couple of weeks.  I can easily get 100+ emails a day, which leaves me little time to respond to everyone individually by email.

## WordPress support question policy

_Please **do not** ask WordPress, theme, or plugin support questions via email; I will not reply._

I'm sorry, but I simply can't answer everyone's questions by email.  I do have a life outside of my blog here, one that includes a job, family, and friends.

If you do have any questions about how to use WordPress, themes, or plugins, you may sign up as a member of the [Theme Hybrid](https://themehybrid.com) community.  There are lots of great people there that would be willing to help you out, and I'm usually answering questions there throughout the day.

## Job requests

The thing you must know up front:  I probably won't take on a custom project unless it's an extremely small plugin or it just interests me so much I wish I'd thought of it first.  I manage several projects and Web sites, which means I typically can't take on additional projects.  However, you are free to submit your proposal to me.  I'll look it over.

You can shoot me an email at `justintadlock [at] gmail.com`.
