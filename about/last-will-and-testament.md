**Song to play at my funeral:**  "Only God Knows Why" - Kid Rock

**Bury me with:**  My class ring, Memorable photos, and My football jersey

## To ... I Leave...

- **G-Daddy:** My porn. So you won't ever have to worry about keeping a girl.
- **Lil' Jon Jon:** My golf clubs.  You might need a decent set to try and get as good as me with.
- **Danny T:** My financial brains.  I don't know where you're gonna get the other 90% to be financially stable though.
- **Timmy:** You can take Amy I guess.  And I would give you some of my cleanliness skills, if I knew you wouldn't let em' go to waste.
- **Amy:** Whatever you want.  Hell, you prolly inherit it all anyway.
- **Vince:** I'll leave you some socks.  So you can wear em' when you put on shoes.  That way your feet won't have that peculiar stench.
- **Kris:** My party pics.  So you'll know how to throw one.
- **Ralph, Lil' Steve, Deuce Dawg, Big Mo':** These final words: "Talkin' bout my girl. MY GIRL!"
- **Rodney:** My body here on earth with yours. RIP bro'
