I've always been a bit of a lone wolf when it comes to WordPress development.  Sometimes this is because others simply don't see what I'm seeing.  Other times, it's because we developers are a little selfish when it comes to control of our code.

However, being a lone wolf makes it harder to grow as a developer and severely limits the amount of time one can use to focus on creating cool things.  Therefore, I'm stepping outside my usual role and teaming up with three other awesome developers and designers:

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://tanid.com" title="Tung Do">Tung Do</a> (aka Small Potato)</li>
	<li><a href="http://ptahdunbar.com" title="Ptah Dunbar">Ptah Dunbar</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://developdaly.com" title="Patrick Daly">Patrick Daly</a></li>
</ul>

Today is the start of something great:  <a href="http://devpress.com" title="DevPress">DevPress</a>.  It is a collaboration of four guys who simply love WordPress and want to create some cool, open source themes, plugins, and tutorials.

<h2>What exactly is DevPress?</h2>

We don't want to pigeonhole ourselves into any specific label, so we're leaving this wide open for a while.

If we absolutely had to give some sort of definition of what the site is about, we'd use something like this:

<ul>
	<li>We want to make themes that are beautiful, functional, and don't require 300+ theme options to work.</li>
	<li>We want to make plugins that simply work and do cool things with WordPress.</li>
	<li>We want to write tutorials that are easy to understand and implement on your site.</li>
</ul>

We want to give things back to the WordPress community.  Don't get me wrong though.  This is a business venture, and we'll be experimenting with various ideas in the future.

<h2>Join us for our site launch</h2>

I'm not going to list all the reasons I think DevPress will be a great site for the WordPress community.  Our work in the coming months should speak for itself, and I hope you like it.
