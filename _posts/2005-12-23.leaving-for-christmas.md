I have been sick for the last few days, and packing up for my move at the end of the month.  That's why I haven't been blogging.  I couldn't find the time, and I just plain didn't feel like it.  I'm going home for a few days for Christmas, so I won't be back until Tuesday.  Maybe I'll get a blog in.  I have to tell the world what wonderful gifts I receive.  Anyways, I'm off to get ready to ride home.
