After grocery shopping today, some guy and his lady waited for me to put my groceries in my car and pull out just so they could get my space.  I know that spot next to where you put your buggy is prime real estate in the Wal-Mart parking lot, but when there's three parking spaces open next to me, I'm going to take my time and make sure you have a good, long wait while praying that some other ass swoops in and takes it at the last moment.
