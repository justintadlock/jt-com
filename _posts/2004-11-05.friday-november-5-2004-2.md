Once again...TGIF! I'm just so excited about that I have the whole day off now. Well...Ever since I got out of Weight Training at 9 o'clock this morning. I'm just here to blog for this second and tell you I put up a <a href="http://www.dark-autumn.com/skins/style.php?set=3" title="Cordelia Skin">New Cordelia Skin</a>. <span class="warning"> Warning! It's explicit!</span> I worked so long last night on a new <i> Angel</i> skin and then, somehow, the picture got erased. I was so mad that I almost didn't do a new one. But I calmed down and started a new one with Cordy. I like it much better. I don't think the <i> Angel</i> skin was that great. Anyways, for your viewing pleasure, here's your new skin. I'm going home now...
