As mentioned in my post <a href="/archives/2006/09/14/fall-tv-on-dvd" title="Fall TV On DVD"> Fall TV On DVD</a>, fall TV is upon us.  I'm currently trying to decide what shows I'm going to watch this upcoming season, and I need to make a decision soon.  Right now, I have four shows on my list:

<ol>
<li>Smallville: Thursday, September 28, 7:00 (CW)</li>
<li>Supernatural: Thursday, September 28, 8:00 (CW)</li>
<li>Veronica Mars: Tuesday, October 3, 8:00 (CW)</li>
<li>One Tree Hill: Wednesday, September 27, 8:00 (CW)</li>
</ol>

<em>(Note: All times are Central)</em>

Obviously, there are no time conflicts since all of the shows are on the same network, <a href="http://www.cwtv.com" title="The CW Website" rel="external"> The CW</a>.  But, I must make a choice.  I really don't need to have fours shows on my must-watch list this year.  It's a little much to handle with work and school.  I can probably rule out <i> Supernatural</i> before the others, but I'm at a loss as to which other show I might take off the list.  <i> Veronica Mars</i> is a must-watch because it needs the fan support this season.  Plus, I felt lost not getting to watch the second half of <i> Smallville</i> last season.  I might have to try my best to get in three shows this season&mdash;one show per night, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday.
