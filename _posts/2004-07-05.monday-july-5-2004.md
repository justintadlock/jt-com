Here I am.  Sitting here staring at my computer.  I've been like this for days.  I've been off of work yesterday and today, and out of school for a week.  I'm very bored.  Very Very Bored.  All I've accomplished is some work on my programming assignment for class. And started building a game on <i> Neverwinter Nights</i>, which will be finished just this some time around never.  Anyways, I'm just bored, once again.  Maybe I'll have something interesting to talk about later... ~ <a href="mailto:webmaster@dark-autumn.com"> greenshady</a>
