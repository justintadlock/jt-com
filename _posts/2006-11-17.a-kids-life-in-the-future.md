Here's a neat video to watch that was posted in one of my Technology, Literacy, & Culture WebCT discussions: <a href="http://digitalmedia.massey.ac.nz/exposure/student.php?id=36" title="Caroline Ting: RAM (External Link)" rel="external"> Caroline Ting: RAM</a>.  We're discussing Ray Kurzweil's <i> The Singularity is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology</i>.  So, the video definitely goes along with that.
