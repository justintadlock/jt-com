This has been a long and painful process, but I've switched hosting accounts from <a href="http://webhosting.yahoo.com" title="Yahoo Webhosting" rel="external"> Yahoo</a> to <a href="http://godaddy.com" title="GoDaddy" rel="external"> GoDaddy</a>.

Now, I'm happy.

The site has been running faster and smoother than it ever has before.  Even my <a href="/archives" title="Archives Page"> archives</a> are loading up in like 1 to 2 seconds, which has never happened for me before.

I had a few problems transferring everything over.  Something I talked about in the last post.  Today, I had a problem with the PHP <code> include</code> function.  It turns out, that you have to add some special root directory beginning to them.  Like, if I include "<code>/page-name</code>," I have to add some other stuff in the front of it.  That took a while to figure out.

Right now, I'm still on a bug hunt.  So, if you're looking around, please comment on this post if you find anything that goes wrong.  As far as I know, everything's working fine, but I can never be sure until I go through every file on this entire site&mdash;a process that'll take a while.

I'm really enjoying the "pretty permalinks" now too.  That's definitely a plus.

Tomorrow, I'll be back on my regular blogging schedule, and no one will have to read about me switching hosts for a while.
