Since I've been a little bit lazy about posting this week, and still so tonight, I have decided to double my readers up on some content.  How's that?  I've posted two new stories in the <a href="http://justintadlock.com/literature" title="Literature and Writings Section"> writings</a> section tonight.

This morning, I finally sent my resume and sample writings to the Union Springs Herald.  I'm applying for an editor job.  It took me two days to put my sample writings together because I literally did not have enough time in the day to do it.  And no, I wasn't on a lazy streak or anything.  I simply didn't have the time.  That was with four hours of sleep a night.

I figured since I was organizing my work, I'd share some of it with my readers.  Here are two of the stories that I sent:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://justintadlock.com/literature/nonfiction/bedtime-adventures" title="Interview With Author of 'The Adventures of Harley Earle,' Jerry Sibley">Bedtime Adventures</a><br />An interview with Jerry Sibley, author from Mount Hope, Ala., who penned <i> The Adventures of Harley Earle</i>.</li>
<li><a href="http://justintadlock.com/literature/nonfiction/the-tiger-taxi-guy" title="A Feature Profile On The Owner Of Tiger Taxi">The Tiger Taxi Guy</a><br />A feature profile on Kevin McCarley, the owner of Tiger Taxi in Auburn, Ala., and his wild nightlife driving an orange taxi in a college town.</li>
</ul>

Wish me luck with the job, and pray that I get an interview!
