Once Again...I'm back.  That will make it the second time today.  I just wanted to post the fact that I have a new <a href="http://" title="Link No Longer Works"><del> ANNUAL CALENDAR</del></a>.  I've been working on it for a while.  I got the code from the <a href="http://javascript.internet.com" title="The Javascript Source Website" rel="external"> The Javascript Source</a>.  It works quite well.  I've just been configuring lots of stuff on it.  It's way better than trying to keep up with my monthly calendar I once used.  Anyways, go check it out if you want to.
