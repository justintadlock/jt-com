Another whole month neglected.  But not without reason.  Okay.  I have had some time to write here in this little section.  I'll get into the control panel and just freeze.  I want to write, but I just can't force myself into it.  I don't know.  Must be some kind of writer's block thing going on.  But, I have to write today.  There's been some big things going on around here.  I just started up my very own web series, <a href="/adayinthelife" rel="external"> A Day In The Life</a>.  It's going alright for now.  Nothing special.  Though, it's getting me back into filming.  Maybe it'll help remove this writer's block also.  You should roam around the site, there's many, many things changing, or progressing.  So, so long for now...

<em>Updates...</em>New Web Series: <a href="films/a/ADayInTheLife"> A Day In The Life</a>, of course.  The <a href="/forum" rel="external"> Forum</a> has some minor changes.  Mostly stuff in the <a href="/films"> Films</a> page has been revamped.  Also, a new <a href="/skins/index.php" rel="external"> Skin</a> has been added. If this is your first time here, then you are currently experiencing the new skin.  I'm sure there's some more stuff, since I haven't updated in a while.  You'll just have to look and see.
