Well here's the new layout!  All done and purtied up huh?  Anyways, I've been hard at work on my new site now.  Well it's a little different.  It's kind of like a Newspaper / Fansite / Buffy & Angel Fansite / Zine / Group type thing.  But it is called <a href="/thesunnydalejournal" title="The Sunnydale Journal" rel="external"> THE SUNNYDALE JOURNAL</a>.  So go check that out.  I think it would be worth your time.  In other news...I may be closing down <a href="/websitechoiceawards" title="Website Choice Awards" rel="external"> Website Choice Awards</a>.  It depends on how many nominations there are in the next few days.  I'm just not getting enough.  Anyways, I hope you like the Cordelia layout.  I'll have to write the next piece of fanfiction soon.  It will continue from <a href="/literature/fanfiction/TheBeginningOfADawn1.php" title="The Beginning Of A Dawn (Chapter 1) Fanfiction"> The Beginning Of A Dawn (Chapter 1)</a> and proceed into chapter 2.  The main story is all about Dawn.  But since I said I would write a fic about each character that I make a layout for, then the focus of chapter 2 will be on Cordelia as a part of Dawn's storyline.  Oh well...I'll be back sometime.  Probably later tonight or tomorrow.  <em> ~greenshady</em>
