My housemate helped me clean today.  He even scrubbed the tub and dusted.  I have no choice but to accept this as divine intervention on a scale never before witnessed by man; there must be some higher power in this universe.  Henceforth, I will dedicate the remainder of my life to finding and learning more about this higher power.
