I'm a little late on this past week's roundup of cool and useful links.  Sorry to those readers that look forward to this every week.  I'm finally over whatever sickness I had and am ready to get back on track with blogging.  Instead of skipping the Weekly Roundup altogether, I've decided to release it anyway.

I didn't do as much blog-hopping last week as I should've because of said sickness, but I have a few useful links for you.  Here they are:

<h3>WordPress:</h3>

Here's some fresh content from the WordPress-o-sphere.  There are some big things happening, and it's going to be interesting to what effect these changes have on the community.

</ul>

<h3>From the feed reader:</h3>

<h3>Design:</h3>

I only have a couple of design-related links for you this week, but they're well worth checking out.  Evan Eckard's site is a must-see.

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.evaneckard.com/" title="Evan Eckard Design">Evan Eckard Design</a>
