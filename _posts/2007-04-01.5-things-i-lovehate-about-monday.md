<ol class="spread">
<li>Waking up early.  This week more so because I've been lazy for a week during my Spring Break.</li>
<li>Realizing that I should've washed clothes over the weekend.</li>
<li>Preparing my lunch since I was too lazy to do it the night before.  (Actually, that's every day of the week.)</li>
<li><i>Introduction to Ethics</i> class.  It could quite possibly be the most boring class I've ever been in.  And, I've had some that have put me to sleep.</li>
<li>Knowing that I've got 4 more days of this before I can relax again.</li>
</ol>
