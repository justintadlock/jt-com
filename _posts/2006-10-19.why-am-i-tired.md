Why am I so tired all of the time?  I'm only 22 years old, and I feel like I'm pushing 40 sometimes.  I didn't have this problem when I first came to college.  I was lively, energetic, and could pull at least two all-nighters in a row if I wanted to.  Now, I can't even manage to take a 4 or 5 hour nap without oversleeping a couple of hours.  Two alarm clocks do no good either.  Why do I need a nap in the first place?  That goes hand-in-hand with my first question.  I'm tired, but I don't know why.

Back in high school, I would get up every day at 6 a.m. and not leave school until almost 7 p.m. during this time of the year.  Sure, I was tired.  But, if I had too, I could go on all night and barely feel the effects the next day.  Now, if I done that, I would nearly fall dead the next day.

I guess it's just part of life.  And don't ask me why I'm writing this at 3 in the morning. <em> Justin, maybe that's why you're tired.</em>  I'm about to go to bed.  Remember I overslept my nap; that's why I'm up at this hour.

People can't handle the same things they could when they were younger.  Maybe it's because I've become a lazy bum.  Not on my exercise plan like I need to be.  Not eating as good as I should be.  I should probably be doing those things.  Maybe I'll get started tomorrow.  It's too late to change my life tonight.
