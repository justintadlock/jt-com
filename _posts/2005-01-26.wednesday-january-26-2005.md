Of course! I don't write enough! Often times, I just plain don't feel like it.  I think I get writer's block way too much.  Which, by the way, is not a good thing.  I'm entering into the major of English now for school.  That's only like the gazillionth time I've changed majors.  I think this one's right for me though.  I'll make my concentration on Creative Writing and my Supporting Coursework will be in Journalism.  Here's a look at an early prediction on what my last 2 years at Auburn University will be like:

<b>Fall 2005</b>
ENGL 4000 Advanced Composition (Major) (3)
ENGL 4530 MODERN AMERICAN LITERATURE  (Major) (3)
FLGR 1020 ELEMENTARY GERMAN II (Foreign Language) (4)
JRNL 3410 PHOTOJOURNALISM  (Supporting Coursework) (3)
JRNL 1100 NEWSPAPER FUNDAMENTALS  (Elective) (3)

<b>Spring 2006</b>
ENGL 4200 Fiction Writing I (Major) (3)
ENGL 3110 Survey of Linguistics (Major)	(3)
ENGL 2140 UNDERSTANDING FICTION (Major) (3)
JRNL 2210 NEWSWRITING (Supporting Coursework) (3)
PHIL 1010 INTRODUCTION TO LOGIC (Core Class) (3)

<b>Fall 2006</b>
ENGL 4210 Fiction Writing II (Major) (3)
ENGL 4220 Poetry Writing I (Major) (3)
ENGL 4570 SOUTHERN LITERATURE (Major) (3)
ENGL 4010 The Personal Essay (Major) (3)
JRNL 3220 FEATURE WRITING (Supporting Coursework) (3)

<b>Spring 2007</b>
ENGL 4430 MODERN BRITISH LITERATURE (Major) (3)
ENGL 4230 POETRY WRITING II (Major) (3)
ENGL 3190 STUDIES IN CHILDREN'S LIT. (Major) (3)
JRNL 4470 ADVANCED FEATURE WRITING (Supporting Coursework) (3)

Kind of scary, huh? But, that's what it will look like, more than likely.  I can substitute another English Class for any of these, or Journalism too.  The English Major kind of lets you pick and choose.  So, these classes are my top picks, as of right now.  I just took my first German test today.  I think I did pretty good.  School's going alright, so far, this semester.  My top goal is to get on the Dean's List this term.  That's something I haven't done before.  And I want to at least do it once, before I get to these upper-level English courses.  Anyways, I promise to keep writing in this little useless box for now on.  At least, a little more often than it's been lately.

<em>Updates...</em>There's been many updates in the last few weeks.  I've worked on the film pages, the people pages are new, I've organized some things to make it look a little nicer, and I've made not one, but two new skins.  And here they are:
