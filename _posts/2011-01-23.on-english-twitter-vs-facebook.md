It's sad that I have more friends on Twitter who can craft a complete sentence in fewer than 140 characters than on Facebook.  My Facebook news feed is filled with trivial updates from people who don't understand how to use a period properly, can't figure out what to do with an uppercase letter, and often lack the ability to form a complete thought.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0205313426?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=justtadl-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0205313426">The Elements of Style</a> (yes, that's a book) is your friend.
