<h2>The authors</h2>

Most of you reading this blog know me well, so I won't say too much about myself here.  If you're unfamiliar with Brad or Ozh, they're pretty awesome and know their stuff.  You can't find better guys to work with that have both the ability to write clearly and code poetically.

You get the knowledge of three developers who often focus on specific areas of plugin development, so we all bring our own unique talents to the mix.  If you want to take a look at some of our publicly-available plugins, check out the following links.
