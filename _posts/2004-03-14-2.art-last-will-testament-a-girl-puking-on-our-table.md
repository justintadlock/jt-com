Well let me see.  Today I added my <a href="/art" title="Art Directory">ART GALLERY</a>, and yesterday I added my <a href="/people/justin_tadlock/articles/LastWillAndTestament.php" title="Last Will &amp; Testament">LAST WILL &amp; TESTAMENT</a>.  So go check out those links if you want.  I think they're at least worth checking out.  Anyways, <em> Aaron</em>, it's been a while since I've got to post up some stuff for you.  So I guess it's about time to do just that.

I see you came up to tigger town the other day /
About that, I just got some things to say /
We had a couple of beers and laughs /
Then a <em> girl</em> made herself look like an ass /
After a few hours had past /
We were all disabled /
I just can't believe that <em> girl</em> puked on our table /
Who drinks tequila without salt and a lime /
That <em> girl</em> must've lost her mind /
But we all tried to be kind /
And we joked on that <em> girl</em> as she left us behind /

Anyways, man, that's about all I got.  I just wanted to give you a few laughs.  I'll holla' atcha' lata'  <em> ~greenshady</em>
