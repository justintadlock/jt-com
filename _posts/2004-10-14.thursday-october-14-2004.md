Well...I'm sitting here, once again, at my computer.  I've been working on the site a little bit, and in between doing World Literature I homework.  Nothing special.  Lately, I've been contemplating over what classes to take in the spring.  And yes, it's about that time, class registration is next month.  So, I decided, since it's hard for me to take more than 2 or 3 classes at a time  (I'm the biggest procrastinator ever) to take three 4-credit classes.  That way, I'll still be full-time.  As of right now, I plan on taking Fundamentals of Computing II(Java 2), Elementary Spanish I, and Biology II(forgot exact name of class).  Then, I'll still have 12 hours, and I'll only have 3 classes.

Website news...I updated the Cast & Crew Section.  I combined it with the Cast Bios to make a more uniform section, with more content to it.  Though, the links to each cast member is lacking.  I also updated the Art Section.  There is a new Video Section, but I'm not sure what, exactly, I'm going to do with it yet.  <a href="http://thesunnydalejournal.dark-autumn.com" title="The Sunnydale Journal: Webzine" rel="external"> The Sunnydale Journal</a> is almost completely reconstructed (just a few more things to add).  So, go check that out.  Okay...I have to leave for class in 15 minutes.  So, until I ramble again...Farewell...
