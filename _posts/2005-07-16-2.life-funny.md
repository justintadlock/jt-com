It's been a long day.  I should've been snuggling with Smeagle and Oly (our 2 cats) a good while ago.  They sleep with me at night.  But, here I am, only a few hours til' daybreak pounding the keys on my laptop.

I got another odd job today.  Lee Canon, a lady I do yardwork for on Thursdays, offered me a one-time bartending job Saturday night, which would technically be tonight.  Letting her know that I don't know the first thing about mixing drinks, she insisted that I do this, and try and get a friend to help.  So, I recruited Charlie, I guy I've known for the past few years.  He's done some bartending in the past.  Ten dollars an hour isn't so bad.  I just hope I don't make a fool of myself trying to do this.  At least I got someone who I know, so I'll feel a little more at ease.

It seems odd.  When I wake up in the mornings I don't think that far ahead into the day and wonder what will become of it.  But that's the funny thing, about life that is.  You never know what's coming your way.  One minute your trying to decide between eggs and waffles for breakfast, the next your taking bartending jobs that you have no clue how to perform.

Life is a funny thing.
