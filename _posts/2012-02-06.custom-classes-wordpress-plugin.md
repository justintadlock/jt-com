For a recent project, I needed a way to add custom post and body classes on a per-post basis.  Sure, I could have used a category or tag to style each post, but I hate creating custom categories and tags for the purposes of styling a post.  So, I created a small plugin to let me add custom classes for individual posts.

<h2>How the plugin works</h2>

The plugin adds a custom meta box on the edit post screen for any public post type called "Classes" as shown in the following screenshot.

The meta box allows you to enter a custom class for a post (used by the <code>post_class()</code> function) or a custom body class (used by the <code>body_class()</code> function).

The following screenshot shows what your <code>&lt;body></code> class will look like in the source code on a single post.

All you have to do is style your posts via <abbr title="Cascading Stylesheets">CSS</abbr> using the custom classes you've addded.

<h2>Download the plugin</h2>

You can download the latest version from the WordPress plugin repository: <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/custom-classes" title="Custom Classes WordPress Plugin">Custom Classes Plugin</a>. I hope you enjoy it and find some use for it in your projects.
