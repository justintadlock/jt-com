A taxonomy is an organization or classification of things by relationship.  The taxonomy system in WordPress is largely untapped but has a lot of potential.

By default, WordPress comes loaded with three taxonomies: <code>category</code>, <code>post_tag</code>, and <code>link_category</code>.  But, plugins and themes can extend this to create even more.

What I'll be showing you in this tutorial is how to make a page template that displays each taxonomy on your site in a cloud format.  You can only do this with WordPress 2.8+.  Prior to 2.8, this was only possible with post tags.

<h2>Creating the page template</h2>

First, you should copy your theme's <code>page.php</code> file.  Save it as <code>taxonomy-clouds.php</code>.  Near the top of it, you'll see this line of code:

```
&lt;?php get_header(); ?>
```

You'll want to change that to:

```
&lt;?php
/**
 * Template Name: Taxonomy Clouds
 */

get_header(); ?>
```

If you need more information on this process, check out my tutorial on how to <a href="http://justintadlock.com/archives/2009/03/13/page-templates-the-untapped-potential-of-wordpress" title="Page templates: The untapped potential of WordPress">create page templates</a>.

<h2>Adding the taxonomy clouds to your template</h2>

Farther down the file, you should see something that looks like this in the code:

```
&lt;?php the_content(); ?>
```

Just below that, we'll add our new code.  What we're actually doing is loading all of the available taxonomies and looping through them.  During each loop, the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags/wp_tag_cloud" title="WordPress Codex: wp_tag_cloud()">wp_tag_cloud()</a> template tag will display the cloud.

```
&lt;?php global $wp_taxonomies; ?&gt;

&lt;?php if ( is_array( $wp_taxonomies ) ) : ?&gt;

	&lt;?php foreach ( $wp_taxonomies as $tax ) : ?&gt;

		&lt;h2 class="taxonomy-label"&gt;&lt;?php echo $tax-&gt;label; ?&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

		&lt;p class="taxonomy-cloud"&gt;
			&lt;?php wp_tag_cloud( array( 'taxonomy' =&gt; $tax-&gt;name, 'number' =&gt; 0 ) ); ?&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- .taxonomy-cloud --&gt;

	&lt;?php endforeach; ?&gt;

&lt;?php endif; ?&gt;
```

<h2>Mixing two untapped features of WordPress</h2>

I've previously called page templates <a href="http://justintadlock.com/archives/2009/03/13/page-templates-the-untapped-potential-of-wordpress" title="Page templates: The untapped potential of WordPress">the untapped potential of WordPress</a>, and the same definitely goes for taxonomies.  What I hope to continue doing with this series is broadening our view of what WordPress can do and get people kick-started in thinking of unique ways of extending the platform.

Have a little fun with your new page template.  Try out some different parameters with the <code>wp_tag_cloud()</code> function.  See what you can come up with.

<p class="note">This tutorial is for WordPress version 2.8+.</p>
