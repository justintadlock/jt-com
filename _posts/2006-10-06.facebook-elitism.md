There are 2,838 members of the <a href="http://www.facebook.com" title="Facebook's Website (New Window)" rel="external"> Facebook</a> group "Against Opening Facebook to Everyone (Official Petition to Facebook)."  So far.

It's our contry's value of elitism.  I admit it.  I have that feeling too.  To be better than anyone else.  "I'm on <a href="http://www.facebook.com" title="Facebook's Website (New Window)" rel="external"> Facebook</a>, and you're stuck on <a href="http://myspace.com" title="MySpace's Website (New Window)" rel="external"> MySpace</a>."  Na-na-na-na.

It's part of human nature, to be an elitist.  Elitism is defined on <a href="http://answers.com" title="Answer's Website (New Window)" rel="external"> Answers.com</a> as

<ol>
<li>The belief that certain persons or members of certain classes or groups deserve favored treatment by virtue of their perceived superiority, as in intellect, social status, or financial resources.</li>
<li>
a) the sense of entitlement enjoyed by such a group or class.
b) control, rule, or domination by such a group or class.
</li>
</ol>

Yes, we college students are elitists when it comes to <a href="http://www.facebook.com" title="Facebook's Website (New Window)" rel="external"> Facebook</a>.  This was created for us, originally.  And we don't want people coming into our home and ruining it.  Especially high school students, right?  With their bad mouths and un-intellectual conversations.

The group, Against Opening Facebook to Everyone (Official Petition to Facebook), argues that they are

> ...against Facebook's latest and greatest sellout, a capitalistic venture that sacrifices the character and integrity of the website that has become a part of school.

The sad truth is, we college students want to feel special.  <a href="http://www.facebook.com" title="Facebook's Website (New Window)" rel="external"> Facebook</a> was for us.  We want to feel superior, in our own class, to those non-college-goers.

I'm in no way arguing for or against allowing people other than college students joining <a href="http://www.facebook.com" title="Facebook's Website (New Window)" rel="external"> Facebook</a>, but I have to admit that the people in charge seem to be simply thinking money, "a capitalistic venture" one might say.  Instead, they should be asking, "Is this right for <a href="http://www.facebook.com" title="Facebook's Website (New Window)" rel="external"> Facebook</a>?"
