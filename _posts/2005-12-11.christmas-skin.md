<strong>Quick Post:</strong><a href="http://www.dark-autumn.com/skins/style.php?set=18" title="Christmas Skin"> New Christmas Design</a>.

So, go ahead, <a href="http://www.dark-autumn.com/skins/style.php?set=18" title="Christmas Skin"> Get In The Holiday Spirit</a>.

It should work in all browsers, but I still have a little tweaking to do here and there.  Nothing major.  I just wanted to go ahead and put it up.  If the site doesn't change skins, you may have to reset your cookies, especially if you've viewed this site with multiple browsers.
