I have yet another television series on DVD to add to my collection, <em> Desperate Housewives</em>.  That's one more for the <a href="/television">DVD Collection</a>.  I know, I shouldn't have spent the money.  But it was just sitting there on the shelf at Wal-Mart, and I just had to buy it.  That's $50 I could've saved for something else.  But what's the use of saving money?  I won't need it when I'm dead.  And plus, I got <em> Desperate Housewives</em> from my hard earned money, and plenty of episodes to see Eva Longoria in.  Speaking of which, I think I may make an Eva Longoria skin/theme/design (whatever you want to call it).

Anyways, it's well past my bedtime, so I'm off to sleep for the next 14 hours or so.
