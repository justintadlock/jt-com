I've got to say I am really really tired.  I slept from like 6:30 this morning until 10:30.  Anyways, I figured out what I'm going to do with this layout.  Well...With several layouts actually.  The whole version 9.0 - 9.9 layouts will be called "The Buffy Series."  That means very often I will make a new "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" layout for the site.  I've already made the second layout, and I like it.  Well, I just wanted to post that.  I don't know if I'll have time to come back and write later today because I'll be studying for my test tomorrow.  So I'll just have to say goodbye for now...  <em> ~greenshady</em>
