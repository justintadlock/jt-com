Sunday morning.  Thermostat set to 65&#176;, while the cool October morning settles itself in at around 41&#176; in Auburn, Alabama...

Okay, I'm not going to post about the weather.  I'm trying to get in a distinctive writing mode for the <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org" title="National Novel Writing Month Website" rel="external"> National Novel Writing Month</a>.  On November 1, 2005, I plan to start my 50,000 word novel.  That totals out to 1,666.666666666666667 words per day or 11,667 words a week.  So, I'll need to come up with 5 pages (double-spaced) every day or 15 pages a week.  That's a lot.  I'm going to attempt it though.  No.  Scratch that.  I'm going to finish it.  I will complete this short novel.  <i> Getting in the right frame of mind.</i>

On that positive note, I'm going to bed.  <i> He says this as his eyes droop even farther down his face, 5 hours too late...</i>
