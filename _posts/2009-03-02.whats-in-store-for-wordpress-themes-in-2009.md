Predicting the future is always an exciting thing to do.  Throw in a few WordPress theme developers and you get some interesting ideas about not only where themes are going but WordPress use in general.

Ian Stewart posted his article, <a href="http://themeshaper.com/future-wordpress-themes-2009/" title="The Future of WordPress Themes 2009">The Future of WordPress Themes 2009</a>.  He asked 15 "designers, developers, and WordPress enthusiasts" to answer the question of where WordPress themes are headed into the future.

It's a great read.  Of course, I had a few things to say (be glad that Ian held us to 500 words or less).  You'll have to scroll down a bit in the article to read my response.

<h2>A few things to note about the article</h2>

Several people mentioned theme frameworks, a subject I'm always happy to <a href="http://justintadlock.com/archives/2008/12/24/why-i-created-a-wordpress-theme-framework" title="Why I created a WordPress theme framework">discuss</a>.  Surprisingly, both Jeff Chandler of <a href="http://wptavern.com" title="WP Tavern">WP Tavern</a> and I both used the phrase <em>The Year of the Theme Framework</em>.  I'm just happy to see folks starting to see the benefits of having a solid base theme.

My <a href="http://themehybrid.com/themes/hybrid" title="Hybrid WordPress theme framework">Hybrid theme</a> was mentioned several times.

Another thing that I didn't get to touch on but several others did is <a href="http://buddypress.org" title="BuddyPress">BuddyPress</a>.  I have some things I'd like to do in that area, but I'm keeping quiet for now.

<h2>Go see what the future holds for WordPress themes</h2>

I don't want to go on too long here.  You should definitely read <a href="http://themeshaper.com/future-wordpress-themes-2009/" title="The Future of WordPress Themes 2009">The Future of WordPress Themes 2009</a> and leave your thoughts.

Also, I just wanted to thank Ian for putting all of this together.  I know it had to be tough to gathering all of our responses.

And, for those of you that missed it, you can see how right/wrong many of us were in last year's <a href="http://themeshaper.com/the-future-of-wordpress-themes/" title="Future of WordPress themes">Future of WordPress Themes</a> post.
