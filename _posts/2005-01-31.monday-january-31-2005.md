You know what? My internet went kabonkers! this weekend.  I'm not sure what's going on with it.  But, my router doesn't seem to be working properly.  I finally got online by just hooking up directly to the modem.  I'll have to look at it more closely sometime this week.  So, that's my excuse for not writing in the last few days.

Anyways, my day has just been another typical Monday.  Went to German class, went to work, then sat at the computer for hours on end.  I did manage to finish up making flashcards for Biology. Big test this Thursday.  Not much in the way of anything exciting.  Oh, yeah, this weekend I bought <i> The O.C. Season 1</i>.  I watched all 27 episodes on Friday night and Saturday.  I absolutely love this show now.  I'll have to make a spot for it in the <a href="http://forum.dark-autumn.com" title="Dark Autumn Forum" rel="external"> Forum</a>.  Well...That's pretty much it in the life of Justin Tadlock.  In light of my Last Will & Testament that I added here's some last words of advice...

<em>
Worry me smilin with G's in my pocket
Have a party at my funeral, let every rapper rock it
And let the hoes
That I used to know
From way before
Kiss me from my head to my toe.

Give me a paper and pen
So I can write about my life of sin
A couple of bottles of Gin
In case I don't get in.
</em>

<em>Updates...</em>Of course, I added a <a href="http://www.dark-autumn.com/people/justin_tadlock/articles/LastWillAndTestament.php"> Last Will & Testament</a> page to my <a href="http://www.dark-autumn.com/people/justin_tadlock/articles/Biography.php" title="Mini Biography"> Mini Biography</a>.  Which, I hope to be a bigger biography at some point.  I also added not one...but two pieces of artwork to the <a href="http://www.dark-autumn.com/art" title="Art Section"> Art</a> section today.  I think that's about it for now.  Anyways, check back later for more website goodies...
