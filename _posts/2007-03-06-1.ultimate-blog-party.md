Susan and Janice, who run <a href="http://www.5minutesformom.com" title="5 Minutes For Mom" rel="external"> 5 Minutes For Mom</a>, are hosting the <a href="http://www.5minutesformom.com/1042/welcome-blog-party" title="Ultimate Blog Party!" rel="external"> Ultimate Blog Party</a>.  You don't have to be a mom to participate either.  It should be a great way to meet new bloggers and make new friends.

<em>About me:</em>
I am a 22-year-old college student at Auburn University.  I will be graduating with an English degree on May 10 this year.  I'm not sure what I'll be doing after I graduate, but I hope I find a job that I love.  Or, at least one that gives me a decent paycheck.

I started my first website back in the Winter/Spring of 2003.  My <a href="http://justintadlock.com/archives/2003/04/15/welcome-to-my-site" title="First Blog Post"> first blog post</a> was on April 15, 2003.  I'm not even sure I knew it was called "blogging" back then, but I was doing it.

Other than blogging and web design, I enjoy writing, reading, playing the keyboard, drawing, filmmaking, and watching movies and TV on DVD.

That's probably enough information about me.  I don't want to start boring my readers.  There's plenty more about me that comes out in my blog posts.  Feel free to browse the <a href="http://justintadlock.com/archives" title="Blog Archives"> archives</a>, or visit some of the other links around the site.
