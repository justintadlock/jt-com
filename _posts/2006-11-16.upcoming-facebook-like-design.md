Yes, I've been influenced by <a href="http://www.facebook.com" title="Facebook's Website (External Link)" rel="external"> Facebook</a>.  So, I've decided to mimic their design for my next theme.  I think I'll call it <a href="/skins/style.php?set=22" title="View The Facebook Mimic Design"> Facebook Mimic</a>.  It's not finished yet.  I haven't decided whether I'm keeping the same colors, and I need a good header.
