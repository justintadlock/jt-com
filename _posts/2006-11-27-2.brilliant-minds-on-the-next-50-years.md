I haven't completely read through over all 70 of the scientists featured in <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/channel/opinion/science-forecasts/dn10580" title="NewScientist.com's 50 Year Forecast (External Link)" rel="external"> Brilliant Minds on the Next 50 Years</a>, but it is worth checking out if you're interested in what the top scientists have to say.
