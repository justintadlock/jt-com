I guess I'm just blogging to blog.  Not any particular thing going on, except I need to get some sleep because I've got to get up and be at work at 10:00.  Well, there is a few things going on, but honestly, I just don't feel like typing it down in this little text area.

I did work on my novel tonight.  I started writing chapter 3, and I just didn't feel inspired.  Plus, I was feeling kind of sleepy.  I managed 2 written pages.  Not much, but I have an idea of where to go with it.  For those of you of have been keeping up, Chapter 3 will be entitled <strong> About The Creeks</strong>.  I'm gonna go into the history of the town and maybe open up a few surprises.  So, get ready.  Hopefully, I'll have it done Saturday night.  So, until next time...
