I just took the <a href="http://www.beliefnet.com/story/76/story_7665_1.html" title="Belief-O-Matic Quiz" rel="external"> Belief-O-Matic Quiz</a> to see what faith I'm aligned the most with.  To my surpise, I'm a <a href="http://www.beliefnet.com/story/80/story_8041_1.html" title="Unitarian Universalist" rel="external"> Unitarian Universalist</a>.  Whatever that means.

Here are the top 5 faiths that the quiz says most closely matches my beliefs:

<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.beliefnet.com/story/80/story_8041_1.html">Unitarian Universalism</a> <em>(100%)</em> </li>
<li><a href="http://www.beliefnet.com/story/80/story_8054_1.html">Reform Judaism</a> <em>(98%)</em> </li>
<li><a href="http://www.beliefnet.com/story/80/story_8058_1.html">Neo-Pagan</a> <em>(97%)</em> </li>
<li><a href="http://www.beliefnet.com/story/80/story_8038_1.html">Liberal Quakers </a><em>(96%)</em> </li>
<li><a href="http://www.beliefnet.com/story/80/story_8028_1.html">Liberal Christian Protestants</a> <em>(86%)</em> </li>
</ol>

Remember, this is only a quiz.  I don't particularly hold to any of these faiths that are represented here.  If anything, I might be more inclined to call myself a Liberal Christian Protestant.  But, I can say that Unitarian Universalism does match many of beliefs because it allows for so much diversity according to the explanation the site gives.

The reason I took this quiz was because I was trying to decide what to provide as my religious views on my Facebook profile.  I searched Google for a few key words and the quiz came up.

At least Facebook has "Unitarian Universalist" and "Christian Protestant" on their list of religious views.  However, you can still type in whatever you want.  Now, if they would only get rid of that drop-down list of political views.  Maybe I could select something other than "Other."

No matter what this quiz says, and whether I align myself with any particular religion, I do believe in God.  I don't take everything in the Bible as literal; I see it as a people trying to understand and explain the meaning of life.  I think religion has been one of the major downfalls of human existence, and one of the most wonderful things in the world.  Religion starts wars.  Religion gives people hope.

I don't want to start preaching about the good and evil of religion.  Although, I do believe that religion has brought about more good than bad.

I'm going to stop writing about it now because it is one of the hardest things to write about, and I've got to finish homework.  Maybe I'll continue this another time, since what I've said here hardly covers my religious beliefs.  Plus, it is a fascinating subject to me.

One final note: I put "Christian - Other" as my religious views on Facebook.  So far, that's the best I answer I can give.
