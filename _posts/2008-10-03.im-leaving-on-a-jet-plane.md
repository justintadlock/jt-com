I've always wanted to title a post with that line.

I'm just hours away from my flight back home.  Actually, I'm about an hour away from leaving; I haven't even showered yet.

I wanted to make one last post to say farewell to Korea.  So, farewell Korea!  I'll miss you.  It's been a long, wonderful ride in this last year.  I wouldn't trade my experience for anything.

For you blog readers, I've schedule a few <a href="http://lorelle.wordpress.com/2006/10/01/working-ahead-future-posts-with-wordpress/" title="Working ahead: Future posts with WordPress">future posts</a>, which is something I don't normally do.  So, we'll see how that works out.

It's a continuation of my <a href="http://justintadlock.com/archives/2008/10/02/if-you-were-a-wordpress-theme-developer-page-templates" title="If you were a WordPress theme developer">If you were a WordPress theme developer</a> series.  Please take some time and leave plenty of feedback.  I hope to turn many of these ideas into WordPress-theme reality when I get settled in.

If you need to contact me by email for the next couple of days, please give me a little time to respond.  If you're a member over at <a href="http://themehybrid.com" title="Theme Hybrid WordPress themes club">Theme Hybrid</a>, try to help each other out on the forums until I get back.

Well, I guess that's it.  I need to finish a few things, shower, and head to the airport.

I'll be writing to you all from the United States next time.
