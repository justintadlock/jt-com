Recently, I needed to build some functionality into a site that disabled the ability to reset the passwords of certain site administrators via the "lost password" form.  However, I wanted to leave this option open for other users in case they needed to reset their password after forgetting it.

Thus, the Prevent Password Reset plugin was born.

<h2>How the plugin works</h2>

Prevent Password Reset is an extremely simple plugin.  It adds a checkbox to the "Personal Options" section of each user's profile page in the WordPress admin as shown in the following screenshot.  Anyone who can edit the user's profile can select this option for the user.

Once this option is selected for a user, their password cannot be reset via the "lost password" form.  The following screenshot shows what happens when someone attempts to reset the password for a user with password preventing enabled.
