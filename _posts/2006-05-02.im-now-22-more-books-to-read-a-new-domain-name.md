Yes, you read that right.  I'm 22 years old.  I don't feel much different, until I say that I'm <strong> 22</strong>.  It feels kind of weird when I say it out loud.  I think I may be getting old.  I still feel like I'm 18, just with a world of knowledge more than what I had when I was that age.  (My birthday was actually on May 1, not on May 2, the date of this post.)

So, what else is going on in my life you ask?
No, I didn't do much for my birthday.  Just the same ol' stuff.  I went to school, then I sat around and did absolutely nothing for the rest of the day.  I usually have to watch a film on Monday afternoons for Contemporary American Literature, but since it was the last day of school, I didn't have to do that.  Of course, the class has no more films to watch.  I worked a little bit on my <a href="http://www.myspace.com/justintadlock" title="Justin Tadlock's Myspace Page" rel="external"> Myspace Page</a>.  Yes, I have fallen prey to <a href="http://www.myspace.com" title="Myspace [dot] Com" rel="external"> Myspace</a>.  But, with good reason.  The only reason, that is, that I started using this wretched thing is because some of my friends have went on a <a href="http://www.myspace.com" title="Myspace [dot] Com" rel="external"> Myspace</a> rage.  I'm only using it to please them and communicate with them.  But do they visit my site here? No.  I should stop using the thing altogether.  It has a good idea behind it, but it has been misused and abused.  A good idea gone bad.

What else has been going on lately?
My roommate, Danny, bought me <em> Fray</em> by Joss Whedon, a graphic novel spin-off type thing based off of <em> Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em>.  I'll have to read that pretty soon.  I actually ordered it off of <a href="http://www.amazon.com" title="Amazon Website" rel="external"> Amazon.com</a> last night, but had to rush back to my room when I received the gift and cancel my order.  I have been planning on reading some of the graphic novels based off of <em> Buffy</em>, <em> Angel</em>, and <em> Firefly</em> for a while now.  I guess this is a good place to start.

We, Danny and I, also bought <em> The Catcher in the Rye</em> by J. D. Salinger the other night.  We figured we'd read a novel together and have some kind of discussion group or something.  I also purchased <em> The Five People You Meet in Heaven</em> by Mitch Albom along with it.  My summer reading list just keeps getting longer and longer.

Anyway, I'm off to bed.  I've got to work at 8 in the morning.  Why do I stay up so late when I know I need to get some sleep?  It's beyond me.

Oh yeah, I almost forgot one thing.  I purchased a new domain name the other day, <a href="http://justintadlock.com" title="Justin Tadlock's Website"> www.justintadlock.com</a>.  No, I'm not changing from <strong> www.dark-autumn.com</strong> or anything.  I just wanted to go ahead and buy the domain before some other Justin Tadlock came along or something.  I'm not sure what I'll do with it.  Right now, it just forwards to this site.  I might give it a subdirectory or something on this site and make it a site all about me, which is essentially what this site is.  I'm not sure yet, but I'll keep you updated on it.
