Ray Kurzweil's <a href="http://www.booktv.org/feature/index.asp?segid=7515&schedID=457">three-hour interview</a> that I watched a couple of weeks back.  If you're interested in the future of genetics and technology, you should definitely check out this interview.  It helped me better understand some of the things he's talking about in <em>The Singularity Is Near</em>.
