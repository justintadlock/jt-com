I deleted my cookies and almost forgot my user name to get into this thing.  Luckily, with a stroke of luck, something struck in my mind and I just happened to remember it.  I said I might post tonight, and here it is.

I didn't get around to working on that paper.  My mind was just too fragile tonight, especially after a day of working on the thing.  I guess I'll have to pull out a miracle paper tomorrow night, or rather tonight now, however you want to look at it.

I've been trying to get this site running better, slower load times, less php including, etc.  Most of it is to do with the "skins" and the "wordpress" part of the code.  And I wasted a lot of time on that tonight, with no results whatsoever.  So, I'm off to bed to get a little bit of shuteye before a new day arrives.
