Hello...Oh so avid readers of mine.  Man it is a sucky day.  I'm pretty sick right now.  I think it's because I was outside without a coat on all Saturday night.  It was kind of chilly.  I had fun at the time though.  Oh well.  I would've wrote Sunday night, but I just haven't felt like it.  I'm going to continue here on the site now, once again every day.  I've also got finals this week.  Well I've got two Saturday and I'll be finished.  OH YEAH! It's my birthday this Thurday also.  Go Me!  I wanted to take pictures of this weekend to post up for everyone to see, but......Well, I dunno, I must've forgot.  Well....I'm kind of tired now, and my brain's not functioning correctly at this moment.  I might write again later today.  ~greenshady
