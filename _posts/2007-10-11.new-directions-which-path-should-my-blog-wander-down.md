Don't let the title fool you.  I have a few specific things in mind that I want to accomplish with this blog.  I have, however, been constantly asking myself this question lately.

I want to do something new with this site.  It's felt a little stale to me for some time now, and I've been thinking about what direction I want to take with it.  I still want it to be my personal blog, a place where I can unleash on the world once in a while or rant or ponder over random musings, but I want to have a more defined direction for the blog overall.

<h3>Some things I want to do:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Offer more <a href="<?php echo get_permalink(573); ?>" title="WordPress Themes"> WordPress themes</a>.</li>
<li>Offer more <a href="<?php echo get_permalink(582); ?>" title="WordPrss Plugins"> WordPress plugins</a>.</li>
<li>Write more WordPress and web design tutorials.</li>
<li>Catch up on my <a href="http://justintadlock.com/topics/book-reviews" title="Book Reviews"> book reviews</a>.</li>
<li>Offer monthly and/or weekly breakdowns of what I've blogged about and some things that I've found interesting online.</li>
<li>Narrow down my <a href="<?php echo get_permalink(566); ?>" title="Topics Archive"> topics (categories)</a> a little more, which would help with putting this site in a more specific direction.</li>
<li>Use <a href="<?php echo get_permalink(565); ?>" title="Tags Archive"> tags</a> to create a better taxonomy system in which users can find related articles.  This would help users better find things they are looking for if the topics are too broad.</li>
<li>Piece together a design that fits with this site, that I like, and offers content to users in a more useful way and stick with it for a while.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Goals:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Get more subscribers to my <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/justintadlock" title="Subscribe to Justin Tadlock's feed"> feed</a>.</li>
<li>Blog daily, or at least write a few quality articles each week.</li>
<li>Double my daily unique visitor and returning visitor counts.</li>
<li>Generate more discussion of my posts.  What's a blog without a few comments once in a while.</li>
<li>Make a few more dollars.</li>
</ul>

Mostly, I want to focus on getting better content out into the web by offering users, as well as the occasional family member that drops in, something of substance.  I want to focus more on the things I love, namely web design and programming.

Now, that I have a few goals written down, I'll have to follow through with them, won't I?  If you have any suggestions or want to tell me what you do or don't like about <a href="http://justintadlock.com" title="Justin Tadlock"> JustinTadlock.com</a>, feel free to do so.
