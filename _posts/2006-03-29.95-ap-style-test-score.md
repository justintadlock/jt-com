Here I am.  On the raggedy edge.  No, not really.  I'm just thinking.  And the thing is, is I don't know what I'm thinking about.  My mind is just wandering from place to place, from village to village inside this (insert unreadable biology word here) network of memories and thoughts inside of my head.

First off, I should have been in bed hours ago.  Next, I made a 95 on my AP Style test in Journalism!  That calls for some kind of celebration doesn't it?  I thought for sure I'd failed it.  Now I'm just waiting for my Comprehensive test score.

Okay, I really just wanted to post that test score up.  Oh, and I know that the word "really" is one of those "leeches that infest the pond of prose--sucking the blood of words," and I shouldn't have used it in the previous sentence.  Strunk &amp; White taught me that.  Just one more thing I've learned from my Journalism class this semester.  I probably shouldn't have used "up" either.  Oh well, I write how I write, and I'll use words as I please.  Maybe I shouldn't get overly arrogant though.

I'm off to get some shuteye.
