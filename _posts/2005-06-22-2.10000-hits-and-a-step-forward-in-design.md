There's not much to say today.  I did surpass 10,000 hits though.  And I had like the most guestbook entries ever for me in one day!  Of course, they were all spammers.  Luckily, this little guestbook of mine blocks that stuff out.  Then I go in and take away their web address and write them a little note.  You know, in case they come back.  Basically it's a way for me to try and be humorous.

I also put a little work into the website that I'm designing, for what I'm now calling, <i> The Autism Project</i>.  I think it looks good, considering I have no information yet to put into it.  It's just a basic template.  You can view it at <a href="http://autism.dark-autumn.com" rel="external"> Autism.Dark-Autumn.com</a>.  Obviously, it still needs a good bit of work.  But nothing that can't be fixed without a little content and a nifty banner.  Anyways, I think that's it for tonight.  It's about time I cook some fries, watch an episode of <i> Joan of Arcadia</i>, and hop in the sack.
