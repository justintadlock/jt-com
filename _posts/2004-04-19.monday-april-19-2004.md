Good Evening, oh so avid readers...I've just been sitting around watching "Angel: Season 1" on DVD.  Well, that's because I've already finished the 2nd season that I bought the other day.  That's what I've been doing most of the weekend.  Of course, I haven't wrote since Thursday.  After that, I had to put together the second issue of <a href="http://thesunnydalejournal.dark-autumn.com" title="The Sunnydale Journal" rel="eternal"> The Sunnydale Journal</a>.  I think it's a pretty good one.  I did all of the writing in it.  It's kind of new, and I haven't quite got the word out about it enough yet.  But good news.  I've already got the third issue's John/Jane Summers.  Yeah, you'd have to visit the site to know what I'm talking about.  Anyways, I'm about to go work on a few things, then hopefully get some sleep.  So...Farewell...  <a href="mailto:webmaster@dark-autumn.com"> Justin</a>
