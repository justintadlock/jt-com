It seems that with every new upgrade of WordPress nowadays, someone is complaining.  <em>Usability testing? This is going to confuse all my clients!  My plugins will break!  What will I do?</em>

I will say that there has been far less complaining in the wait for 2.7 than the last couple of versions &mdash; it does have a pretty slick interface built in, doesn't it?

Let's take a quick stroll down memory lane.

<h2>WordPress version 1.2</h2>

I first started tinkering with WordPress during the 1.2 days.  I didn't use it on this site until <a href="http://justintadlock.com/archives/2005/05/13/still-finding-style" title="Still finding style">May 2005</a> (version 1.5).

Earlier today, I decided to set up a test install of 1.2 just to see how far the platform has come since I first installed it.

I actually screwed up the initial install somehow.  It was probably because I had to use this crazy file system.  As it turns out, 1.2 is not even in the <a href="http://wordpress.org/download/svn/" title="WordPress Subversion access">Subversion repository</a>.  I did manage to get it installed though.

If you've ever once said that WordPress needs to slow down or not update so often...

	<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">WordPress version 1.2 write post screen</figcaption>
</figure>

Yes, that's the <em>Write Post</em> screen you're looking at.  Not much to it, but it got the job done as best it could.

<h2>Like those beautiful themes we have these days?</h2>

Yeah, it was much harder back in the day to dress up your blog.  Imagine editing your lonely <code>index.php</code> file to run your blog only to get this:

<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width:594px">
	<img src="http://justintadlock.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/wordpress-12-default-theme.png" alt="Default style of WordPress version 1.2" title="WordPress 1.2 Default Theme" width="594" height="202" class="size-full wp-image-1180" />
	<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Default style of WordPress version 1.2</figcaption>
</figure>

OK.  So, today's Default theme isn't much cooler, but you couldn't manipulate the look and feel of your blog like you can now.

<h2>Still don't like advancement?</h2>

I suppose I could go on listing all the advancements WordPress has made in such a short amount of time and why I love each new version that comes out, but I'd rather not.  I have to go play around with WordPress 2.7 Beta a little.

If you can honestly tell me that you'd rather go back to the <em>good ol'</em> days, then I'll just have to take your word for it.  The <strong>only</strong> argument I could see you making is one based on simplicity.

It doesn't take three PhDs and an IQ of 180 to run a WordPress blog these days though, so that argument is trivial.

I tend to like a few <em>bells and whistles</em> with my blogging platform anyway.

The point of this post is not to <em>point</em> fingers at anyone that's complaining (you know who you are!).  It's just to remind everyone that we should be thankful to be a part of such a wonderful community and using a platform that <em>does</em> get updated regularly.
