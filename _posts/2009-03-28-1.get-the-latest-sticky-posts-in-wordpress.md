excerpt   : "Problem: You need to query the first x number of sticky posts in WordPress.  Solution: Read the guide on how to load these posts."
---

I came across an interesting question the other day.  A user wanted to know how to query a specific number of sticky posts for the front page.  Generally, I just point people to the <a href="http://www.nathanrice.net/blog/definitive-sticky-posts-guide-for-wordpress-27/" title="Definitive Sticky Posts Guide for WordPress">Definitive Sticky Posts Guide for WordPress</a>, but this question was not covered.

The problem:

<ul>
	<li>User has many sticky posts (maybe 100s).</li>
	<li>User wants to only show a specific number of those ordered by date.</li>
</ul>

Some of you may be thinking that this should be extremely simple.  But, let me warn you, I thought the same thing at first.  I had to actually put on the ol' <em>thinking cap</em> for this one.

<h2>Get the latest x number of sticky posts</h2>

I'll assume you already have <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/The_Loop" title="The WordPress Loop">The Loop</a> set up in one of your template files (i.e., <code>home.php</code>, <code>custom-page.php</code>).  What we need to do is call up a specific number of stickies.  For this example, we'll load the two latest sticky posts.

Place this code before your Loop:

```
&lt;?php
	/* Get all sticky posts */
	$sticky = get_option( 'sticky_posts' );

	/* Sort the stickies with the newest ones at the top */
	rsort( $sticky );

	/* Get the 2 newest stickies (change 2 for a different number) */
	$sticky = array_slice( $sticky, 0, 2 );

	/* Query sticky posts */
	query_posts( array( 'post__in' => $sticky, 'caller_get_posts' => 1 ) );
?&gt;
```

We have to use <code>rsort()</code> to sort the sticky posts in reverse order by post <acronym title="Identification">ID</acronym> (newer posts first).  The reason for this is because sticky posts are added to the sticky array according to when they were made sticky, not by <acronym title="Identification">ID</acronym>.

We have to set <code>caller_get_posts</code> to <code>1</code>.  Otherwise, we'd get all stickies added.

<del>The biggest problem here is that you have to add <code>$sticky[0]</code>, <code>$sticky[1]</code>, <code>$sticky[2]</code>, and so on.  But, typing a few extra characters is a small price to pay for the functionality it offers.</del> Updated: Hat tip to <a href="http://nathanrice.net" title="Nathan Rice">Nathan Rice</a> for the <code>array_slice()</code> solution.

<h2>Other solutions for sticky-post issues?</h2>

As more users start taking advantage of sticky posts, there'll probably be more issues such as this one pop up.  Have you run into any problems querying sticky posts in a certain way?  If so, how did you figure it out?

I hope this tutorial at least helps some of you out when working with sticky posts.  If you have a more elegant solution for the issue posted above, I'd love to see the code.
