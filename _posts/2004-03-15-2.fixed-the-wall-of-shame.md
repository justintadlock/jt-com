Alright folks...Just to let you know I fixed up the <a href="http://" title="Link No Longer Available"><del> WALL OF SHAME</del></a> today.  I redone it with iframes.  It still has the same look though.  It's just easier to navigate through now.  Anyways...I just wanted to go ahead and post that.  Hopefully, I'll be back later tonight.  Signing off...  <em> ~greenshady</em>
