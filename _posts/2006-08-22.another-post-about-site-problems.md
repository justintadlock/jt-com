Okay, now my database seems to up and running fine.  It did go down for a few minutes earlier tonight.  It was enough minutes to make me go ahead and purchase a hosting account with <a href="http://www.site5.com" title="Site5's Website" rel="external"> Site5</a>.  I'm thinking of transferring my site to them, but I haven't decided yet.  I might just use it as a backup site, in case the database goes down on this one.  Of course, if my database goes down again, I might just be through with <a href="http://webhosting.yahoo.com" title="Yahoo Webhosting" rel="external"> Yahoo</a>.  I'll just have to wait and see if this becomes a major problem.

To top off a weekend of frustration, I was working with some new plugins for <a href="http://www.wordpress.org" title="Wordpress's Website" rel="external"> Wordpress</a>, and some of them didn't even work right.  Another wasted night fooling with this site.

So, yet again, I'm up later than I should be.  But, that's inevitable.  So, I hope my blog will pertain to something other than fixing this site for the next few days.
