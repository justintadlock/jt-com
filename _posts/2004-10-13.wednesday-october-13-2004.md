Guess what!  I woke up late today.  Therefore, I missed my 8:00 Weight Training Class.  I got up at exactly 7:55.  Yeah, only five minutes before class started.  I would've only been about fifteen minutes late if I had went, but I wanted to eat breakfast at least.  So, I've had another fun-filled morning working on the website and finishing my Java homework.

Updates...Amy and I moulded her teeth yesterday, so they're in the Photo Gallery - Make Up Section.  I also added a new Writing.  And a section for Artwork.  Last night, we worked on the Theme Song a while.  Maybe I'll have that posted in the next week or so.  Also, I've started up my other site: <a href="http://thesunnydalejournal.dark-autumn.com" title="The Sunnydale Journal: Webzine" rel="external"> The Sunnydale Journal</a>, last night.  It isn't totally reconstructed, but it is usable.  So you can go check that out.  Well...my time is now up, or rather I'm tired of typing this morning, so I'll have to go rest for now...
