"They say you can never go home again."

I was thinking about that quote a couple of weekends ago (I know, I should've been blogging since then).  I was homesick.  It took a couple of weeks, but I felt it.  Really, I just didn't have anything to do.  I was sitting around my empty apartment on the weekend, waiting to do <em> nothing</em>.  I'm over it now though.

It's probably common to be a little homesick sometimes.  If I only had a few more of my things, it would be easier.  Now, don't get me wrong.  I'm enjoying Korean culture.  There are some things I miss.

<ul>
<li>Milk that doesn't taste like it's going to be sour tomorrow.</li>
<li>Good hamburger meat (ground beef).</li>
<li>Wal-Mart (Even though I hate what they're doing to the Mom-and-Pop stores, I'm a Wal-Mart addict).</li>
<li>Oly and Smeagle (my cats).</li>
<li>Of course, I miss family, but I'm used to not seeing them for months at a time.</li>
<li>Clothes drier.</li>
<li>American football.</li>
</ul>

There are a few other things I miss, but these are the main ones.  I really miss football.  [insert sad Justin face]

Back to the original quote.  I was thinking about that line because I wanted to go home like I've never wanted to go home before.  Alabama, my home.

I think I have this ideal vision of what home means, but that home doesn't exist.  At least not anymore.  I haven't truly been home (Highland Home, Ala.) in the last five years.  It's definitely a part of me.  Much of what or who I am has been shaped by that place.  But, I've changed since then.  That's why they say you can never go home again&mdash;it's not because home is different; it's because you're different.

A different person.  Home is that place as you remember it.  Home is a memory.  Memories are in the past and will forever be there.

Part of it is my dreams.  Since I've been here, I've had the most vivid dreams of things that have happened and things that never happened.  But, they all come back to Highland Home and Auburn, Ala.  Those places.  It's a bit freaky how vivid my dreams have been.  (Maybe it's because I've been reading Stephen King's <em> Dark Tower</em> series.)

So, about South Korea&mdash;I'm living the dream.  Sometimes, I have to sit back and tell myself, "I'm living in a foreign country."  I'm living the freakin' dream.  "L-I-V-I-N."  I have to reflect on that thought for a few moments.

And guess what?  I love teaching.  It's quite possible that I've found my calling (other than writing the great Southern American novel, of course).

I love the culture here.  People are generally a lot nicer than Americans.  Emphasis on <em> a lot</em>.  I will start taking Korean language classes this Friday.  So, wish me luck.  Also, I'm flying to Japan next Tuesday and Wednesday to get my work visa, which is very cool.  After that, I'll have the USA, Mexico, South Korea, and Japan crossed off on my "countries visited" list.  (Okay, so the USA doesn't really count.)

As a side note:  one of the reasons I haven't blogged as much is because of electrical problems.  My plug converter doesn't work well with my computer.  So, I have to charge up my computer battery, then get on the computer, which gives me a limited amount of time.  I use most of that time to keep in contact with others through e-mail, messenger, MySpace, and Facebook.  I hope to find an adapter soon, so that I can keep my computer powered all the time.

Maybe I'll upload some pictures soon.  Until then, have a good night or morning or afternoon&mdash;wherever you are.
