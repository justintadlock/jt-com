If you would've told me back in May, when I graduated college, that I'd be where I'm at right now or doing what I'm doing right now, I probably would've asked you what medication you were on.

In just a few short hours, I'll be boarding a plane, taking off for Fukuoka, Japan.  This is what is called a "visa run."  Basically, I'm going over to get my work visa for the next year.

One summer.  Three vast, new places.  Life is funny.

I moved to Atlanta, Ga. earlier this summer to stay with my sister.  Took a crap job.  Got offered a better job in Seoul, South Korea.  Now, here I am.  One month into my stay in Korea, I'm leaving for Japan for a couple of days.  My tourist visa has now expired.

One summer.  Three countries.  Life is a bit funny sometimes.

Needless to say, I've been a bit lost all summer.  Learning and coming to appreciate new homes, then packing up and leaving.  Not to mention that I left my five-year home of Auburn, Ala.  And I loved that place.

Chuseok is coming up soon.  Friday's our first day off work for this major Korean holiday.  I don't have any travel plans since I don't have much money at the moment.  It should give me a few days to recuperate and get my bearings.

I've had a long, twisting, turning summer.  A few days of downtime is probably what I need.

I'm off to catch a plane.
