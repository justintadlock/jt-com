It was a long weekend, but I finished putting the pieces of <a href="http://amynrussell.com" title="Amy Russell" rel="external"> Amy's website</a> together.  I'm happy with the results of the design mostly.  It has made me reconsider how I structure my website.  So, I might have a lot of housecleaning to do if I decide to do a little restructuring.

I guess I'm off to bed.  I hope I get a chance to blog about <a href="http://www.thnt.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060726/NEWS/607260437/1001" title="Lawsuit On Coaches Praying With Teams" rel="external"> Coach And Team Prayer</a> tomorrow night.  It's a subject that's been on my mind for a while.
