Oh gosh!  I have another stupid Psychology test tomorrow.  And I have to turn in an English Comp. II paper.  Which it was actually pretty fun writing, since it was a movie review of <i> Chicago</i>.  So no complaints here.  At least it wasn't one of those stupid "Plagiarism" papers we've been writing all semester.  Anyways, Santanna, if you happen to read this, I'm sorry.  I forgot to wish you happy birthday on here Tuesday.  So I'm telling you now.  HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!  Man...It's getting late.  I've got a test in like 8 hours, and I haven't even went to sleep yet.  Which I prolly won't for a few more hours.  HaHa!  I don't sleep enough at night anyways.

In other news, I added a new <a href="#link-removed"> drawing contest</a> today.  So go check that out.  Especially if you can draw just a lil' bit.  <br />Wow!  I'm addicted to <a href="http://www.neopets.com" title="NeoPets Website" rel="external"> NeoPets</a> too!  I have a lil' Nimmo and his name is Nimmonionion and he has a PetPet named Lil Nimmonio.  Cool names huh??  Anyways......I guess I'm about to go do something productive.  Like study a lil' bit.  ~/grnshdy
