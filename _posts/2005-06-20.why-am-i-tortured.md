I'm bored.  Yes, I said bored.  Once again, I'm up late and thinking to myself that life is passing by and I forgot to hop on the train.  I think I spend more time dreaming of action, adventure, romance, and drama than I spend doing something about it.  Maybe I just feel like I need to have these qualities every second of the day.  I want to continue shooting short films.  Why haven't I picked up the camera?  I want to get back into shape.  Why haven't I hit the gym?  I want to find my true love.  Why haven't I been on a real date in...a very long time?  These are the things that run through my mind constantly.  I seriously think my brain will be my demise.

I'm a tortured artist without vitality.
Color has lost its hue, it's only darkness.
I'm a fallen angel without a paradise.
Eden has lost its innocence and beauty.
I exist only through blank pages of an empty void consumed only by meaningless matter.

Okay, there's a little bit of my dark tortured soul.  Now that I got that out of my system...
Oh, I cooked up another skin.  It's one of <strong> Sophia Bush</strong> from <em> One Tree Hill</em>.

As for the rest of my life, well, it's back to work tomorrow with the same old monotonous crap that completely devours every last bit of me and leaves only emptiness.
