Not much time for bloggin today. I'm already late going to bed. I needed to be asleep by like 11 o'clock. I think I can now officially confirm my own addiction to the internet. New episode of <i> Smallville</i> came on tonight. So, my review is up on the <a href="http://forum.dark-autumn.com" title="Dark Autumn Forum" rel="external"> Forum</a>. So, go check that out. No updates for today. I actually spent most of the night searching for a good PHP editor. And found nothing really good. Not one of them explained what to do very well. But I did find a good programming editor, it's called <a href="http://www.pnotepad.org" title="The Programmer's Notepad Website" rel="external"> The Programmer's Notepad</a>. It's very helpful for lots of different languages. You can color the syntax in way you want. You can get it <a href="http://www.pnotepad.org" title="The Programmer's Notepad Website" rel="external"> HERE</a>. Anyways, I've got a big day tomorrow, so I'm off to bed. I'll blog a little better tomorrow...
