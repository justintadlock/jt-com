Here I am...Having trouble sleeping again...It's like this every freakin' day.  It don't matter what time I get up in the morning or how many hours sleep I get.  I just can't go to bed at a decent hour.  I guess I'm going to have to pull another all-nighter and try to get my sleep schedule going right.  Anyways, I didn't get around to writing yesterday.  Even though, it was practically yesterday.  "Only 24 hours and 17 minutes until."  Well, whatever...I'm bored.  But HEY PEOPLE!  Sign up for the <a href="/websitechoiceawards" title="Website Choice Awards" rel="external"> PEOPLE'S WEBSITE CHOICE AWARDS</a>.  We've got to get these things rolling.  You know moving.  On the way.  Yeah, Okay...Ummmm.....I guess that's about it for right now.  I should go think up some ideas or watch an episode of "Angel" or something.  Yes, I went out and bought the first season of "Angel" on DVD.  I've got like one or two episodes left on the fourth disc.  So Farewell...All...  <em>  ~greenshady</em>
