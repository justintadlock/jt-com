Soooo Sorry to my avid readers for not writing lately.  I've been really busy with work and packing my stuff up to move out.  I've got one week left until I get to move in my new apartment.  *yay*  Anyways, not much has been going on except that.  I got a rather interesting <a href="http://" title="Link No Longer Available"><del> guestbook</del></a> entry today.  Rest assured, I'm going to go off on this anonymous person in the <a href="http://" title="Link No Longer Available"><del> wall of shame</del></a> here in the next few days.  So go check that out sometime soon.  I've decided against owning my own domain.  It's too time consuming right now, but maybe I will sometime down the road.  Well I need to get in bed, because I've got to get some sleep before I go to work this afternoon.  So goodbye.  And come back soon.  ~greenshady
