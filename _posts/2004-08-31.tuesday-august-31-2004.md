Well...I just got through watching <i> The Passion of the Christ</i>, and I must say, that it is one of the better films that I watched in a while.  I'm not going to put it on my top 5 list, but it is definitely worthy of my number one that I've seen this year.  For any of you that haven't seen it, I recommend going out and renting or buying a copy.  It's worth it.  That's if you haven't already seen it.  Which is very few people who watch movies.  I didn't get a chance to see it in the theaters, I just happened to be broke the whole time it was playing.  Anyways, I'm just starting to ramble on, I've got to go get ready for class.  Until next time... <a href="mailto:webmaster@dark-autumn.com"> ~greenshady</a>
