Well...Here it is!  I've updated, though not completely.  I've put quite a bit of work in this site so far, this afternoon.  I have all the links in the menu working.  There's not too much content at the moment, but I'm working on it.  I had to finish writing a program in Java, for this lab I have at 2:00.  Then I got to work on the site a little bit.  I've updated the css and all the pages in the menu except for the forum.  That might take some time to update.  There's a whole lot more involved in that.  Though, I was never completely finished with it the first time around.  So, how do you like the new look?  I think it's simple, yet gives the site a nice, neat look.  I'm looking for comments and ideas.  So, go ahead and sign the <a href="http://gresevil.signmyguestbook.com" title="Link No Longer Valid" rel="external"><del> guestbook</del></a>.  I'll have plenty more things updated by the end of the week.  I think everything's working out great for the moment, and hope it continues that way.  Anyways, off to class I go...
