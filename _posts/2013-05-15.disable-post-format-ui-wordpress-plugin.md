And, for the simplest plugin I've ever created (it's a one-liner), I introduce Disable Post Format <abbr title="User Interface">UI</abbr>.

I love that WordPress is all about the <em>decisions over options</em> mantra, but that sometimes means some users get stuck with stuff they don't want.  I figured there's probably plenty of folks who aren't that interested in post formats, so I made a quick plugin to disable the post format <abbr title="User Interface">UI</abbr> being introduced in WordPress 3.6.

You can grab a copy from the plugin page on <a href="http://themehybrid.com/plugins/disable-post-format-ui" title="Theme Hybrid: Disable Post Format UI">Theme Hybrid</a> or from <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/disable-post-format-ui/" title="WordPress: Disable Post Format UI">WordPress.org</a>.

<h2>What does the plugin do, exactly?</h2>

If you haven't been keeping up with WordPress 3.6 development, you're in for a treat.  WordPress is finally doing something about those ambiguous post formats.  From now on, all WordPress installs will support all post formats out of the box.  They've done some cool <abbr title="User Interface">UI</abbr> work on the edit post screen in the admin to make post formats much more usable for the average user.

The following is a screenshot of what this looks like.

This plugin simply disables this new <abbr title="User Interface">UI</abbr> and its functionality for people who have no need for post formats.
