I have decided to write in my little notepad my entries for my website.  This way I can keep posting on the happenings of Thanksgiving week and then post them up when I get back to the luxury of my own home.

I didn't really feel like writing much tonight simply because I feel totally drained, but I'll try to present a few note-worthy comments.  I read through to page 119 of <i> The Gatekeepers</i> by Jacques Steinberg tonight.  So far, it has been quite an interesting read.  The basis of the book is set at Weselyan College (or University or something, I forgot its exact name).  Steinberg gets to sit in on the 9-month long journey of one of the eight admissions officers of the premier college and observe the process of allowing high school seniors fill its limited seats.  I never realized what goes into the process before covering the first half of this book, and if the second half is near as good as the first, I expect to be even more shocked as the revelations unfold.

Anyways, that's a bit of what I've been doing today, other than the drive home and the writing of the epilogue of my novel, <i> Creek Hill</i>.  So, until...you know the drill.
