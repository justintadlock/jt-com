It's no secret that Britney Spears might have lost her mind.  It's no secret that she partied with Paris Hilton, and didn't wear any undies while doing it.

It's certainly no secret that Britney shaved her own head last Friday, then continued over to an L. A. tattoo parlor to have little lips inked on her wrist.

I don't think the bald look is coming into style any time soon in America, at least not if you're a woman.  I've read that the look is becoming quite popular among men celebs.

Britney shouldn't hog all the news though.  She's had too much media attention in the last few months.

Here's a look at some other celebs who've sheared their hair.  However, I must note that they were paid money for losing their locks.

Demi Moore donned the shaved look in <i> G.I. Jane</i>, in which she played a senator who enrolled in the Navy SEALS training program.  She had the tough look going though.  Not a bad looking woman, even with no hair.  Moore's head at least helped with female self-empowerment.

Sigourney Weaver went shaved in <i> Alien<sup>3</sup></i>.  I haven't seen the movie, but I added her because she kept popping up when I was looking for pics of other celebs with shaved heads.  I'm not sure why her head was shaved.  Maybe the aliens done it or that was the look for the time.

My favorite actress who has shaved her head is Natalie Portman.  She played Evey in <i> V for Vendetta</i>, and had to lose her hair to go undercover.  Quite possibly the most beautiful woman without hair I've seen yet.  I don't know if there's a bad look for her.

Obviously, these other celebs won't make the headlines, but at least there's one blog post in the blogosphere with their names in it.

Are there any other female celebs who've shaved their heads?  For money or because they've lost their minds?
