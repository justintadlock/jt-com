excerpt   : "Desert island scenario: What one feature would you add to your WordPress theme if it was the last change you ever got to make to your site?"
---

One of the posts I think maybe some of you've been itching for me write in the <a href="http://justintadlock.com/archives/2008/10/02/if-you-were-a-wordpress-theme-developer-page-templates" title="If you were a WP theme designer series">If you were a WordPress theme developer series</a> is about really cool features.

In this sixth post, I want to ask you a very simple question: If you were developing your own WordPress theme, what essential feature would you add?

Forget about everything else for a moment.  Think of this as a desert island scenario.  If you had to choose <strong>one feature</strong> for the rest of your blog's existence, what would that feature be?

Some of you may think that having no features is a feature itself, and that's a perfectly valid answer.

<h2>What are theme features?</h2>

Well, there are no <em>set-in-stone</em> rules here.  Anything goes.

I'll give you a few examples:

<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://www.wpelements.com/2008/08/28/the-featured-content-gallery-plugin-v20-now-fully-automated/" title="Featured Content Gallery plugin">Featured Content Gallery</a> plugin that runs off <a href="http://smoothgallery.jondesign.net/" title="SmoothGallery">SmoothGallery</a>.</li>
<li>Ability to place widgets virtually anywhere, such as in the <a href="http://themeshaper.com/thematic-for-wordpress/" title="Thematic: A WordPress theme framework">Thematic theme</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://themehybrid.com/demo/structure/index.php?wptheme=Structure" title="Structure WordPress theme">Tabbed</a> content and in the sidebar.</li>
<li>Built-in <a href="http://www.nathanrice.net/proximity/" title="Proximity News Theme">SEO options</a> in the theme backend.</li>
<li><a href="http://justintadlock.com/archives/2008/05/27/get-the-image-wordpress-plugin" title="Get the Image WordPress plugin">Auto-generated thumbnails</a> for your archive pages.</li>
</ul>

Those are just examples.  Features don't have to be as flashy or complex as some of those.

<h2>What feature would you add to your WordPress theme?</h2>

Take some time to think about it.  Remember, you only get to choose <strong>one feature</strong> for your site.  Make it a good one.

Ideally, this feature should <em>stand the test of time</em> because in our scenario, it'll forever be on your site.

I'm really excited about reading some of your answers.
