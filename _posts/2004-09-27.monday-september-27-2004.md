Another week...Another day in the life of Justin Tadlock.  Tests, programs, projects...Need I go on?  I've been a little wore-out from school over the past few days.  I need to just relax a little.  I haven't had time to work on my film script over the past week at all.  As soon as I get done writing here, I have to go finish a 1200 word paper that I've been working on.  It's due tomorrow.  I finished my Java program last night, that's due today.  And my Java activities that due Wednesday.  Then I have to finish my Java excercises that are due Wednesday.  On Thursday I have a World Literature I exam and a Java(Fundamentals of Computing I) Exam.  And my week will be about complete.  So, I'm definitely going a little crazy over school work.  And it's only Monday!  I'll be like the walking dead by Friday.  I'll be taking a trip home on Friday, to go see the folks, and hang out with some friends.  Then the cycle starts all over again.
