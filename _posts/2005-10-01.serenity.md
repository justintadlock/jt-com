I definitely have a reason to write tonight.  I just got through watching one of the most amazing movies I've ever seen in the theater: <em> SERENITY</em>.

Joss Whedon pulls off a masterpiece in this follow-up to his short-lived series <em> Firefly</em>. From every syllable uttered to every camera angle, the crew behind this movie put their heart and souls into the making of this film.  Kudos to everyone involved in this project.  I'm definitely looking forward to seeing this on <acronym title="Digital Video Disc"> DVD</acronym>.  Hopefully, the box-office numbers will reflect what a great movie this is and allow the crew of Serenity to live on.

This is one movie that I would pay the $7.75 to see again in the theater.
