Since this is my first theme for public release, I hope there's not too many problems.  Take a test run of the theme to see if you like it.  Mine is a slightly modified version of it because it's got a few things specific to this site.

Leave a comment if you find any problems, or if you want to discuss what should be added, taken away, etc.  In order for me to make great themes for <a href="http://wordpress.org" title="Wordpress"> Wordpress</a>, I'll need great support.
