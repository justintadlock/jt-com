Hello All...  Well, I have great news... I'm finally getting myself a job.  Actually I've been working on it for a while.  It is a new Internet Site created by me and my roomates.  We're selling products for cheaper than what most stores sell them.  It's not all up and running yet, but you can visit the site at <a href="http://" title="Link No Longer Available"> PocketEasy</a>.  PocketEasy is the tentative title for now.  And we will soon, hopefully in about a week have it all put together with a our own .com name.  So wish us the best.  Also I would like to have as much feedback as possible, so don't be afraid to tell me what you think would be good products or ideas to sell.  Right now, we're open to all suggestions.  Well, sorry, I can't rant too much longer.  I've got to get to work on the CakeWalk site.  So long...  ~greenshady.
