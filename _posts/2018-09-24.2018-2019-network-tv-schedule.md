It's premiere night at my house tonight, which means it's time to break out the pizza and soda.

With the season premieres of _The Big Bang Theory_, _Young Sheldon_, and _Manifest_, I thought it was time to share my 2018-2019 network TV schedule.

One of my favorite things to do in the late summer and early fall of the year is to fill out my calendar with show times for the upcoming season.  Narrowing down the shows I'm interested in vs. what I actually have time to watch can be a challenge.

Deciding on which shows get the axe when there's a time conflict is typically the least fun part of the process.  Fortunately, this year, one of the awesome folks over at [Theme Hybrid](https://themehybrid.com) passed along a [Tablo DVR](https://www.amazon.com/Tablo-4-Tuner-Digital-Recorder-Streaming/dp/B00MWLZR0I?tag=justtadl-20) that they no longer had use for.  And, I had an external hard drive gathering dust for saving recordings.  Now, I shouldn't have to worry about conflicts.  I'll probably reevaluate my schedule in the coming days since this development (just got the Tablo on Friday).

## Schedule

The following list will change over time.  I'll inevitably drop a show or two.  I'll pick up others that don't currently have a listing or air until the winter/spring.

## No cable?

People always ask me why I don't have cable/satellite TV.  Actually, with cord-cutting becoming more popular these days, I get the question far less often.

I dropped cable back in the early 2000s when I was a broke college student.  I've never had much reason to justify the exorbitant price over the years.

If you're interested in the antenna I use, it's an outdoor [ViewTV antenna](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XGPXFWY?tag=justtadl-20).  I pick up all the major networks plus a few others in a rural area.  I get about 22 channels on most days, depending on conditions.  Given a taller pole (mine is at 8 feet), I could probably pick up more.  But, I'm content with what I have.

For the handful of cable shows that I do watch, I catch up on those via Netflix or DVD/Blu-Ray.
