Well...It's a brand new month.  A month of love and ummm...well, not for me.  Just school and work for me.  Another typical month.  It's been two days in a row that I've gotten guestbook messages from people advertising job websites.  People! People! This is not a place to advertise your business sites.  But, by all means advertise you personal website.  Other than that, it's a no-go.

I just got through watching <i> Angel: Season 2</i> episode <i> Trial</i>.  I was chatting it up on the message board that I freqent, <a href="http://www.kryptonsite.com" title="Kryptonsite Website" rel="external"> Kryptonsite</a>, on the <i> Angel</i> thread.  And I just had a sudden urge to watch one of the Darla episodes (pre-vampire).  I rather enjoy watching those old episodes.  It brings back very fond memories.  But, guess what!  <i> Angel: Season 5</i> is coming out on DVD in two weeks!  Two Weeks! That's February 14! I have yet to see Season 5, so it's going to be an awesome week for me watching through the last and final chapter of the entire <i> Buffyverse</i>.  Though, I have heard rumors of a possible <i> Angel</i> movie in the works.  But, for now, it looks like it's not happening.  Maybe some good news will come someday for us avid <i> Buffy & Angel</i> fans.  Anyways, I'm off to bed here in a few minutes.  So, until a new day...
