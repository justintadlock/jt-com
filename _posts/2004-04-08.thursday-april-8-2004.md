I'm Back!  Woo-hoo!  Anyways, I've been working a lot on <a href="/thesunnydalejournal" title="The Sunnydale Jouranl" rel="external"> The Sunnydale Journal</a> here lately.  Sorry for not having too many new ideas for the site.  So I'm actually kind of merging them together, but not really together.  This is more of my daily thing, and that's more of my weekly thing.  But they're both part of the same big project.  Mostly I've been doing buttons for the place, and really just trying to get word out about the site.  But I've been working on a few layouts for this site also.  And here are the pictures for your viewing pleasure:
