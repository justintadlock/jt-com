However, viewers voted her to the top female slot on the show.  This is a fairly important piece of news.  Click on over to the article and just look at the picture of this beautiful woman.

Jen Hunter, the model, responded, "You don't have to be a size eight to be beautiful. I am trying to change an industry that is so set in its ways and its definition of what is beautiful. It is so hard and harsh at times."

Also, the very healthy-looking Scarlett Johansson topped <a href="http://www.fhmus.com/girls_100_sexiest_2006_14.asp?cnl_id=1&stn_id=72" title="FHM Sexiest Women Winner (External Link)" rel="external"> FHM's 100 Sexiest Women</a> this year.

Could we be embarking on an age where the ideal woman is once again curvy?
