<h3>Thoughts</h3>

I started working on this theme way back around April 2007 when I wanted to design a newpaper-style theme.  I wasn't sure which direction to go in then and I'm still not sure now that I've completed this project.  Of course, I didn't spend the last several months working on it.  I took a very long break.  It wasn't until reading Adii's article, <a href="http://www.adii.co.za/2007/10/01/magazine-style-themes-are-here" title="Magazine Style Themes Are Here"> Magazine Style Themes are here</a> that I realized I wanted to play with my old theme again.

Now, this isn't exactly a set-in-stone newspaper-style theme, but it's far different than the typical blog theme.  (I would go as far as saying that this is my best work.)  I put a lot of hours into this project and almost gave up after several mishaps with alignment (I hate you IE6!!!), but somehow, just somehow, I managed to come up with something that I like, something that can be used for both blogs and news sites, something that doesn't take a lot of work for the blogger.

I don't know where I came up with the name "Newspaperize."  I just remember that's what I wanted to call it when I started in April, and it just kind of stuck.  I went through four completely different redesigns before I settled with what we have here.  Overall, I'm happy with it.  Of course, when little bugs start creeping up, I'll be frustrated again.

With that said, please report all your bugs in the forums.  Not on my About page.  Not on some obscure post that has nothing to do with WordPress themes.  Here on this post.  So, what do you think?
