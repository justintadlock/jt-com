I've designed my <a href="http://www.dark-autumn.com/bodyforlife/workout/cardio.php"> cardio workout</a> from and article called <a href="http://www.bodyforlife.com/exercise/trainingTips.asp?cmsId=485" rel="external"> The No-Frills Cardio Challenge: How to lose twice the fat in half the time</a> from the <a href="http://www.bodyforlife.com" rel="external"> Body-For-Life website.</a>  It's a pretty intense workout.

I put together all of the workouts, at least the first versions of them.

I'll tell you, the cardio workout was rough.  I warmed up for about 5 minutes, then completed the first 3 intervals and had to stop.  I was about to quit, but I gave myself a 5-minute rest and ran the 4th interval.  Then I rested another minute and finished up the 5th interval.  Needless to say, I felt like I got one of the best workouts I've had in a long time, all within 15 minutes.

<em>Total Cardio Workout:</em> 100% (With a 5 min & a 1 min break)
<em>Total Meals:</em> 66.67% (4 / 6)
<em>Total Glasses Of Water</em> 80% (8 / 10)
