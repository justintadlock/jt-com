Alright...  Well it's been a long day.  I've finally got my .net domain name for my new site.  It's still pending on some stuff though.  It will be called PocketEasy.net.  You can check out the construction of it right now by clicking <a href="http://" title="Link No Longer Available"><del> HERE</del></a>.  I will be selling all kind of products there, so please give me feedback and comments on anything, including: the look and feel, the products I should sell, and anything in particular that you would like to see.  Whew...That was quite a long sentence.  Well here's a little saying to end this ranting about the new site:  <i> What would you do if you could die young, but live forever?</i>  <em> ~greenshady</em>
