Once again, I'm late getting back in bed.  My nap ran over almost two hours.  I was supposed to sleep from 8 p.m. until 11 p.m., but I didn't get up until 12:40.  Now, I'm stuck with no time left for blogging.  I need to be hitting the important topics like North Korea blowing up a nuke or something today.  I've got to stay on top of these hot topics.

Sometime soon, I would like to write a review of Philip K. Dick's book, <i> Selected Stories of Philip K. Dick</i>.  It was quite an interesting read.  We had a lot of great discussions on the material in Technology, Literacy, &amp; Culture.  But, I don't want to delve right into it at the moment.  I'll save that for later.

I hope I can manage to come up with a new <a href="/skins" title="Skins/Themes/Designs"> theme</a> this weekend.  I've been planning on doing it for a while, but haven't gotten around to it.

Well, I'm off to bed.  And, I'm leaving this blog, once again, wanting.
