I'm back from my weekend trip home. It seemed so short. But, I did get some rest in while I was there. I pretty much spent the whole weekend just laying around at my Dad's and Granny's houses, watched a little football, done some homework, and watched <i> Star Wars: Episodes IV & V</i>. I'm not a <i> Star Wars</i> geek, if you were wondering. But I do enjoy watching a good action flick every now and then. Actually, I've never even seen <i> Episodes I & II</i>. There, that proves it, no SW geek here. I'm trying to hurry up and do a little typing here, cause I've got to go to bed very, very soon. Okay, that's about it for now. I'll catch back up with bloggin tomorrow.

<em>Updates</em>...I added a new <a href="http://www.dark-autumn.com/projects/index.php" title="Link No Longer Works"><del> PROJECTS</del></a> section. It's not fully-loaded just yet. It's mainly going to be for organizing all my film projects. And don't forget to go check out the <a href="http://www.dark-autumn.com/skins" title="Select A Design"> SKINS</a> section. I've done a lot of work on them. I think everyone will enjoy the <i> Roswell</i> &amp; Cordy: Undressed skins. Anyways, off to bed I go...
