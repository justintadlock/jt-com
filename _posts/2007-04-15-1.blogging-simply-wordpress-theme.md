This is my second Wordpress theme.  I hope everything works right.  I'm always assuming something will go wrong.

I wanted to do something simple this time.  Something that would load fast.  Also, I wanted room to add a gazillion things on the sidebar.  I figured, <em> why not make two sidebars?</em>  I like the colors on this theme a lot, even though I haven't tested them on any other computer than my laptop.  Anyway, go ahead and enjoy the theme!

Leave a comment if you find any problems, or if you want to discuss what should be added, taken away, etc.  Or, just tell me whether you like it.
