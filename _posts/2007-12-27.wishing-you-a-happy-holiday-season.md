I wanted to put up a quick post to see how everything is going for my readers.  I hope everyone is having a great holiday season.

I spent several hours on the Web cam with my family while they opened presents on Christmas.  It was a neat experience seeing most of them for the first time in over four months all together.  It kind of makes me wish I was home for a week or so.

This doesn't mean I'm not enjoying the holidays here in Korea though.  I received two boxes of Kraft Macaroni and Cheese in a game of Dirty Santa (White Elephant, whatever you call it).  So, it's been a good Christmas.  My parents did send over a package with lots of goodies too.

The family-like atmosphere with the foreign teachers at my school has made being away from home at Christmas an enjoyable experience.  Now, I'm looking forward to New Year's Eve in Seoul.

Look for plenty of updates and more free content in 2008.  I have several projects up my sleeve.  Until then, enjoy the holidays.
