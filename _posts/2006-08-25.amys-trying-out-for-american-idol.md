I guess I have to make a post about this.  My sister is trying out for <a href="http://www.americanidol.com" title="American Idol" rel="external"> American Idol</a>.  Well, she is leaving next Thursday for Memphis.  I just got her a website last night, <a href="http://amynrussell.com" title="Amy N Russell's Website" rel="external"> Amy N Russell</a>.  I would've posted it up then, but my database was screwing up again.  I haven't styled the site yet, but it's still functional.  I should have it up and running beautifully before the weekend's out.  That's if <a href="http://webhosting.yahoo.com" title="Yahoo Webhosting" rel="external"> Yahoo</a> can manage to keep my database running.  Then everyone can be updated on her <a href="http://www.americanidol.com" title="American Idol" rel="external"> American Idol</a> progress.

Anyway, I'm off to bed.  I'll be doing some serious work to her <a href="http://amynrussell.com" title="Amy N Russell's Website" rel="external"> website</a> this weekend.
