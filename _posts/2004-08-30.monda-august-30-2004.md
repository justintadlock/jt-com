Yay! A new layout! I've been in the process of revamping this whole website for a while.  I just get lazy sometimes and mostly uninspired.  It might take some time to really get this thing up and running, but I'm kind of in the mood to play with the site a little.  The new look?  Yep...The Smallville Series...I know. I know. I was doing a whole Buffy Series, but it just got played out I guess.  I'd rather have something a little fresher than Buffy.  Even though I totally love the show.  Smallville is my fave show for the moment, so I have to get inspiration from somewhere.  Anyways...I have to go for now.  But until next time...Ciao!  <a href="mailto:webmaster@dark-autumn.com"> ~greenshady</a>
