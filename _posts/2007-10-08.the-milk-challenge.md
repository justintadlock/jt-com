Lately, I've been blogging a little too much about WordPress and all kinds of mumbo-jumbo for the Internet junkies.  Today, however, I'm going to share with you a little movie.  Yes, a movie!  Last Monday, I was put to the "Milk Challenge."  Little did I know, when I decided to take this challenge, that it was physically impossible.

It started as a friendly conversation last Monday over some mondu (beef-wrapped dumplings, my favorite food in Korea).  One of my coworkers and I got into a conversation about drinking a gallon of milk in 15 minutes.  I said, "I can do it."  I'm not sure what was going through my head at that moment and what the other details of that conversation were, but I know I said I could do it.

Fast forward a few minutes.  My coworker and another left the restaurant before I did to get back to the office, and when I got back, there was already a pool going on whether I could actually do it.  I had few supporters (mostly people encouraging me enough to do it and see me vomit).

<strong>The challenge:</strong>

<ul>
<li>Drink a gallon of milk.</li>
<li>You have 15 minutes.</li>
<li>You cannot vomit.</li>
<li>The milk is provided.</li>
<li>$5 payout if you finish.</li>
</ul>

Worst idea of all ideas ever.  Here is the result of my little challenge.  I made it through 2.5 liters of milk, which isn't too bad.  (<strong>Warning!  Do not watch if you have a weak stomach.</strong>)

Yes, that was nearly 2.5 liters of milk coming back out of me at once.  And, let me tell you, that wasn't the worst of it.  Drinking that much milk is not natural.  It does horrors to your bowel movements.  I have never heard my stomach make some of the noises it made last week.  At least my coworker gave me $5 for effort.

As a side note:  the "real" milk challenge is supposed to be done in an hour.  I didn't find out that little piece of information until a little later in the day, after I'd already signed myself up to vomit my milk.
