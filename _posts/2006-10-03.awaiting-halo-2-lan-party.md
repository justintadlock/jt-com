For some reason I couldn't manage to get in my nap tonight.  I tried at 5:00, 7:00, and 9:00, all without success.  Now, I'm up way too late, finishing up little things that I need to take care of, like a short story, this blog, and posting my Halo 2 LAN Party for Friday night on <a href="http://www.facebook.com" title="Facebook Website (New Window)" rel="external"> Facebook</a>.

Maybe that's the reason I can't get any sleep.  I'm getting too excited about killing all my friends off in a heated eight hour match of Halo 2.  My mind doesn't want sleep.  It wants blood.

Nevertheless, I must get some sleep now.  I've got to get up early and edit that story for Fiction Writing.
