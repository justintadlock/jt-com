excerpt   : "How users can create a custom functions plugin rather than dropping useful functionality into their theme's functions file."
---

Most of the WordPress tutorials I write mention adding custom functions to your theme's <code>functions.php</code> file.  Many of the other tutorials around the Web will use this same technique for adding custom code.  However, there are different ways of handling custom functions.

Telling a user to drop code in their theme's <code>functions.php</code> file makes things easy for both the developer and the user.  It's easy to understand because nearly every theme has this file and users are accustomed to editing their theme rather than dealing with plugin code.

This tutorial will walk you through two plugin alternatives to using a theme functions file.

<h2>The big problem with editing themes</h2>

Before moving forward, you should know that there's nothing wrong with adding custom code to a theme's <code>functions.php</code> file, especially if the code is directly related to the theme you're using.  That's not a problem at all.

The problem occurs when you add custom functions that aren't necessarily tied to a theme such as when creating custom <a href="http://justintadlock.com/archives/2010/04/29/custom-post-types-in-wordpress" title="Custom post types in WordPress">post types</a>, <a href="http://justintadlock.com/archives/2009/05/06/custom-taxonomies-in-wordpress-28" title="Custom taxonomies in WordPress 2.8">taxonomies</a>, or <a href="http://justintadlock.com/archives/2009/05/09/using-shortcodes-to-show-members-only-content" title="Using shortcodes to show members-only content">shortcodes</a>.  Most of the time, you'd want to keep these types of things separate from your theme because you'd like to retain the functionality when you switch themes.

Of course, you can transfer one theme's <code>functions.php</code> code over to another theme, but why not make it even easier, requiring no transfer of code?

<h2>Creating a custom functions plugin</h2>

For the two methods described in this tutorial, you will need to create a custom functions plugin.  This plugin will house all of your custom functions.  Before doing anything else, create a file called <code>my-custom-functions.php</code> on your computer.  Place the following code in this file.

```
&lt;?php
/**
 * Plugin Name: My Custom Functions
 * Plugin URI: http://yoursite.com
 * Description: This is an awesome custom plugin with functionality that I'd like to keep when switching things.
 * Author: Your Name
 * Author URI: http://yoursite.com
 * Version: 0.1.0
 */

/* Place custom code below this line. */

/* Place custom code above this line. */
?>
```

You can change the information at the top of this file to suit you.  I prefer to leave the name as <em>My Custom Functions</em> so that I know it holds stuff that I've created.

<h2>Option #1: "Must-Use" plugin</h2>

Not many WordPress users are aware of what's called the <code>mu-plugins</code> folder.  WordPress doesn't even ship with this folder by default, so it's a bit of a hidden gem that I wish more folks knew about.  Traditionally, it's been thought of as part of the multi-site (old WordPress <acronym title="Multi-User">MU</acronym>) setup by many people, but this folder works for single-site installs too.

The "mu" in the <code>mu-plugins</code> folder name stands for "must use."  What this means is that any plugins in this folder automatically run on all sites (single site or all sites on a multi-site install).  There's no need to activate them.  They just run.  This should feel familiar to those of you that are used to having code that just runs when adding it to your theme's <code>functions.php</code>.

If you don't already have a must-use plugins folder, go to the <code>wp-content</code> directory on your WordPress install and create a sub-directory named <code>mu-plugins</code>.  Then, add your <code>my-custom-functions.php</code> file to this directory.  Your directory should look like the following:

```
/wp-content
	/mu-plugins
		/my-custom-functions.php
```

If you visit your plugins page in the WordPress admin, you should see a new option named "Must Use" alongside your active and inactive plugins as shown in the following screenshot.

As shown in the screenshot, there's no "activate" link for the plugin.  It's already running on your site since it's in the <code>mu-plugins</code> directory.

The only downside to using this option is that you can't <em>deactivate</em> the plugin without manually removing the file from your site using <acronym title="File Transfer Protocol">FTP</acronym> or whatever other method you use for adding/removing files from your site.  If this worries you, follow along for another option.

<h2>Option #2: Regular plugin</h2>

If you'd rather have a plugin that you can activate/deactivate, you can create a regular plugin.  The process is much the same as in the previous step.  Rather than adding your plugin to the <code>mu-plugins</code> folder, you would add your <code>my-custom-functions.php</code> file to the <code>plugins</code> folder in the <code>wp-content</code> directory.

Your file and directory structure would look like the following:

```
/wp-content
	/plugins
		/my-custom-functions.php
```

If you visit the plugins screen in the WordPress admin, you'll see <em>My Custom Functions</em> listed in your regular list of plugins as shown in the following screenshot.

<img src="http://justintadlock.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/custom-plugin.png" alt="Custom functions plugin on the WordPress plugins screen" title="Custom functions plugin" width="600" height="207" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2710" />

Remember, this will behave like a regular plugin, so it won't automatically run like a must-use plugin.  You still have to activate it.

The biggest downside to this option is that the plugin is mixed in with all your other plugins.  I prefer the separation of the <code>mu-plugins</code> folder for things that I plan to always have running on my sites.

<h2>Get started with your custom functions plugin</h2>

Every time you read a tutorial with something you'd like to do in WordPress, stop and think a moment before implementing its code if it asks you to add it to your theme's <code>functions.php</code> file.  Ask yourself the following questions.

<ul>
	<li>Is this something I only want to happen when using my current theme?</li>
	<li>Is this functionality I want to keep regardless of the theme I'm using?</li>
</ul>

If you can answer those two questions, you'll know where the code needs to go.
