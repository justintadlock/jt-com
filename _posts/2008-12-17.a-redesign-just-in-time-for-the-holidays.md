Yes, there is yet another redesign at JustinTadlock.com.  I wanted something a little <em>Christmasy</em> though, so this is my attempt at a Christmas-based theme.

I've never been good at Christmas themes at all, but I figured I'd give it one more shot.  My Santa in the header image could probably use a little more touching up, but I'm tired of messing with it.

I put this together in less than half an hour (minus the header image) because I just modified a preexisting theme.

Maybe when the new year rolls around, I'll have enough time to do a true redesign of the site.

<h2>Get the theme my design is based on</h2>

This is actually a slight modification to my latest theme at Theme Hybrid, <a href="http://themehybrid.com/archives/2008/12/leviathan-wordpress-theme" title="Leviathan WordPress theme">Leviathan</a>.

It is another GPL-licensed theme that you can download for free.  It is also a child theme of my <a href="http://themehybrid.com/themes/hybrid" title="Hybrid WordPress theme framework">Hybrid theme framework</a>, which is probably the most feature-rich WordPress theme you can find.

It's definitely worth a look if you're looking for a new theme that can be both professional and personal.
