I generally assume the best in people.  I assume they are smart enough to distinguish between fluff and facts.  I assume they immediately recognize the stench when they're being fed BS.  I assume they can escape the whirlwind of spinning truth.

Then again, many people watch <em>Jersey Shore</em>.  Maybe there is no hope.
