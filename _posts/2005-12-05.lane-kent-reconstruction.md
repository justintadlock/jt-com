Quick post.  Okay.  I got nothing.  Oh yeah, I've been working on a site design for <a href="http://laneandkent.com.foreverclois.com" title="Lane &amp; Kent" rel="external"> Lane &amp; Kent</a>.  Hopefully, that'll be up in a few days.  I will be making a <b> Web Design</b> page sometime in the next couple of weeks.  I may be busy with finals and all.

Actually, I have been restructuring the site (am I not always?).  I want the code to run smoother and all that other good stuff.  A lot of it is internal, which you'll never see directly.  It's mostly stuff to make me happy, and to make the site more user-friendly.

Anyways, I'm off to bed.
