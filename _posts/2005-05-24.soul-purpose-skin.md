I basically wanted to do a quick update.  I've accomplished the task of building a new skin for the site.  Yes, a new skin, once again.  What I need to do is go back and work on the old ones that haven't been configured for the changes in the site structure.  I learned some new things today about <a href="http://www.wordpress.org" rel="external"> Wordpress</a>, which I use for this little blog area.  I actually took its menu and included it with my pre-existing menu, that you can see on this page.  Anyways, I hope you like the new <a href="http://www.dark-autumn.com/skins/style.php?set=13"> Soul Purpose skin</a>.  I put a whole lot of work into it.  So, if you don't see it loaded in your browser (people who've been to the site before), then check it out:
