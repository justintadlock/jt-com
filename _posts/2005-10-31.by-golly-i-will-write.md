Man, I didn't realize how late it was.  I've been sitting here for a while working on my style sheet for this site.  Basically, I have been tidying up the <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets"> CSS</acronym> with comments, changing the capital letters to lowercase letters, and organizing the code into a more readable state.  I'm getting ready for a move to <acronym title="eXtensible Hypertext Markup Language"> XHTML</acronym>.  I decided to do this because it is the route that web development is taking.  I have to move along with the times.  Since I decided on this change, I will have to go through and uncapitalize all the uppercase letters in my tags throughout my entire website.  Yeah, it is going to take some time.  This is a project that won't get finished any time soon.  But, I don't want to bore you with talk of coding the website.

Don't forget, in less than 24 hours <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org" title="National Novel Writing Month" rel="external"> National Novel Writing Month</a> will begin.  I plan to sit down at 12 o'clock midnight and begin writing.  I may not get much done, but I will write.  By golly, I will write something down on paper.  <i> By golly?</i>  I will begin to write the Great Southern American Novel.  50,000 words.

<i>The Great Southern American Novel by Justin Tadlock.</i>  Has a nice ring to it doesn't it?
