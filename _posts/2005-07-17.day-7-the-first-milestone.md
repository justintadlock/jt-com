I finished up my 7th day!  That's the first big milestone.  Now, I have only 77 days left to go!  I completed my first EDT cardio workout today.  I finished up the 3 miles in 44 minutes and 17 seconds.  I done the first half mile in 22 min and 49 sec.  So, next week I'll have to beat this week's time.  I also got a nasty rash on my inner thighs and a blistered spot on the top of my heel from this run.  Well, it wasn't really a run.  It was mostly a walk.  Since it's the first EDT workout and I turned my ankle yesterday, I walked most of the 3 miles.  I hit a few 50 yards or so jogs on the way.

I started a nutrition tracker with my profile at <a href="http://www.freetrainers.com" rel="external"> Free Trainers.com</a>.  It's a good place to keep track of what you eat.  They also have fitness plans and a message board.  I'm basically using it to keep track of my daily intakes.  I want to see if I'm getting enough carbohydrates, proteins, calories, and fats, so I don't go overboard, and so I can make sure I'm burning more calories than I take in.

Today, after my EDT training I put together a short video with a little information on it.  This is because I said I would at least do one video tracking my progress a week.  So here it is: <a href="http://dark-autumn.com/bodyforlife/videos/BodyForLifeDay7.wmv">Day 7 Video</a>
