These are all items I have on my  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/31ZQROTXPR9IS/ref=wl_web/" title="My Wishlist On Amazon (External Link)" rel="external"> Amazon Wish List</a>.  So, pop on over there if you want to get me something.

I've wanted an HD DVD player since they first arrived in the spring.  Yet, they've cost way too much money up until this point.  I know the add-on for the Xbox 360 probably won't have all the greatest features or best resolution capabilities, but it'll hold me over for quite a while.

Notice how I'm putting the high-priced stuff at the top of the list?  I have always stuck with Nintendo when it came to consoles, and I'm not about to stop now.  Plus, I've really got to try out the new controller.

<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0679753338?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=justtadl-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0679753338" title="Buy Nobody's Fool From Amazon" rel="external">Nobody's Fool</a> by Richard Russo<br />
Ever since I've read Russo's <i> Empire Falls</i> I've wanted to read some more of his work.  He is by far one of the better writers that I've ever read.  He's the kind of writer that inspires me to write better.

I had to read Warren's <i> Brother To Dragons</i> in my Southern Literature class, and I didn't really like him that much.  I mean, who writes a poem the size of a novel?  However, I have heard that this novel is his best work.  Plus, I'll probably watch the movie when it comes out, so I'll have to read the book first.

Originally, I started watching this show last fall because it had David Boreanaz (from <i> Angel</i>) in it.  After a few episodes, I thought the series wouldn't last, and I quit watching.  To my surprise, one of my classmates recently told me that the show picked up some steam after the beginning of the first season.  Now I'm wondering what happened, and I must see it.

Honestly, I came across this book a couple of weeks ago and thought it looked interesting.

My Fiction Writing I teacher is constantly quoting Ueland from this book.  I figured if she can pull so many good quotes about writing from it to help us in class, it must be a decent read.

It's funny how I came across this title a while back.  A friend and I were talking about what types of TV shows we wanted to see made (we were seriously missing new episodes of <i> Buffy</i> and <i> Angel</i>).  And I mentioned I would like to see something about the old days, way back in the Roman empire times.  Of course, he told me about the show.  Now only if I could get that million bucks that I've been hoping to land in my lap...

Best sitcom ever (end of sentence punctuation)

I've been interested in these ethnographic works centering on high school since I had a class on literacy last fall in which we wrote our own ethnographies.  The works that pushed me toward the high school area were <i> A Tribe Apart</i> and <i> Wonderland</i>, and more recently, <i> School of Dreams</i>.

No TV on DVD collection would be complete without it.  I've been trying to catch up on watching all of the seasons since last Christmas.  Obviously, I'm still far behind.

Another series that I've been trying to catch up on.  I generally have to wait for the price to drop $30 before I can buy one of these HBO series though.  And, <i> The Sopranos</i> is just a good show.

I had to add at least one more classic to my list.  I've always wanted to read this one, and it has a catchy title.  So, it belongs on the list.
