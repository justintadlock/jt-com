I went home (where I grew up) on Friday and Saturday to see my cousin who had drove down from Ohio to visit.  However, this is not the story I will relate today.

Before I left to come back to my home in Auburn, my mom gave me a check and told me to buy my Christmas presents because she couldn't find anything on my list.  Yes, I'm 22, and I still have a Christmas list.

This is not by choice.

Every year, my grandmother and mother are always asking for a complete list of things I want.  I usually respond with, "Surprise me," or "Whatever you think I need."  Ultimately, I have to hand over a list of things (my dad and stepmom check out my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/31ZQROTXPR9IS/ref=wl_web" title="Amazon Wish List" rel="external"> Amazon Wish List</a>).

At some point in the last few years, I guess I must've realized that Christmas gifts will never be the same as they were when I was a kid.  I don't feel like I have a good list to give them.  It's usually just a few books and DVDs.  Nothing really special.

And I feel like Christmas has become so much more of a commercialized holiday for me by handing out carefully prepared lists (I wouldn't want two of the same thing), even if I do have that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/31ZQROTXPR9IS/ref=wl_web" title="Amazon Wish List" rel="external"> Amazon Wish List</a>, at this age.

I don't much care what gifts I get for Christmas anymore because most of the material things that I want, I'll probably purchase myself at some point.

Instead, rent the local V.F.W. hall or a hotel ballroom, deck it with boughs of holly, and invite the entire town for a vast blowout. O.K., it won't bring world peace. But if we have this primordial capacity for collective joy, why not put it to use?

I think Ehrenreich is on to something.  What if we just let go of the commercialization of Christmas for at least, possibly, a weekend and have a little fun?

I certainly wasn't one of these people in a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6fq1bvdLGI" title="Customers Fight Over PS3" rel="external"> fight over the cool, new PS3</a> (I'm rooting for the Wii anyway).  And I know that event has been trampled over by bloggers worldwide 100s of times over now, but is this what Christmas has come to?

I honestly didn't want to start blogging about the commercialization of Christmas, but my mind wonders a bit sometimes.

I guess I could use the money my mom gave me to throw some sort of a holiday shindig and spread a little Christmas cheer.  Or, I could click on over to <a href="http://amazon.com" title="Amazon" rel="external"> Amazon</a> and buy something for myself.

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/31ZQROTXPR9IS/ref=wl_web" title="Amazon Wish List" rel="external">Amazon Wish List</a>, here I come!

I can't help it.  It's money I can spend on myself.  Spread holiday cheer?  What a crazy idea.
