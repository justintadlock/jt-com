Some of you may remember that I told you a while back that I was taking the plunge and <a href="http://justintadlock.com/archives/2008/09/30/revealing-my-secret-plan" title="Revealing my secret plan">working online from home</a>.  Well, that hasn't changed.  However, I also wanted to have a little fun and do some other things I've been wanting to do for a while.

At about the same time, an opportunity revealed itself.  One of my favorite sites was <a href="http://popcritics.com/2008/09/the-end-of-a-very-short-era-pop-critics-shuts-down" title="The end of Pop Critics">shutting down</a>.  After talking with the owners (and going through all the <em>legal stuff</em>), I became the proud owner of <a href="http://popcritics.com" title="Pop Critics: Reviewing pop culture so you don't have to">Pop Critics</a>.

<h2>Why I took over the site</h2>

For one, I didn't want to see it go because they've always had some great material to keep my <em>inner pop culture nerd</em> satisfied.

Mostly, I wanted to get back into writing about things other than WordPress a bit.  I love all things TV, movies, and books &mdash; a perfect match.

I've also always secretly wanted to redesign the site, which I'll be doing soon.

So, this is the fun thing I wanted to add to my schedule to sort of <em>let off some steam</em>.

<h2>Do you like popular culture enough to write about it?</h2>

I'll go ahead and let you know, this isn't a paying gig.  It's all about having a little fun.

If you like anything about any movies, television series, books, comics, music, or any other facet of Pop Culture, this may be an opportunity to get your name out on a well-known site.

Just <a href="http://justintadlock.com/contact" title="Contact page">drop me a line</a> or leave a comment below if you want to participate in this project.  I'll get back to you <acronym title="As Soon As Possible">ASAP</acronym>.

This could be loads of fun!
