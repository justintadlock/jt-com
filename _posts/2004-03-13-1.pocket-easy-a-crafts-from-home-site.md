Hello...All...I know I've been talkin a little about PocketEasy.net lately.  Well...My roomates and I have been talking it over, and decided that for now the site will be a crafts from home site.  So that means, we'll have to do a little more research.  Which in turn, also means, it may take another week or so to get the site up and running.  That sets our deadline back to about two weeks from now.  Oh well...I just wanted to mention that for now. I'll be back later tonight to blog on crazy stuff or whatever...  <em> ~greenshady</em>
