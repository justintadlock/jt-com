Where has the time gone?  I have spent 6 hours of my night reading away at Ian McEwan's <i> Atonement</i> and Stephen King's <i> Salem's Lot</i>.  And, I still haven't finished the reading assigment for either one of them.  Forty more pages in McEwan's novel and 60 in King's.  I don't even feel like blogging at all.  Besides, I don't have much to offer to the world tonight.

<strong>Novel update:</strong>  I am completely restarting this whole thing.  Well, I'm going to go back to my original idea.  I think I captured a small portion of it in the first chapter, so that'll stay.  I still haven't decided on the first-person / third person <acronym title="Point Of View"> POV</acronym>.  I suppose I'll have to know by tomorrow.  That'll leave me with approximately 2,273 words to write every day through the rest of <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org" title="National Novel Writing Month Website" rel="external"> National Novel Writing Month</a>.  Crap!  With a capital <strong> C</strong>  at that!  Whatever, I'm going to finish this thing, one way or another.  I don't care if I only write 50,000 words of pure CRAP.  I will finish.  By God, I will finish if it's the last thing I do in my lifetime.  I will go without sleep for a week if I have to.  I might even take up coffee-drinking for 22 days.  Coffee???  Ughhh.  I will do what it takes.  So, if you have actually read any part of the novel so far, disregard everything you've read.  I will start fresh.  Coffee or no coffee, I will write like a madman.
