I'll be leaving town for a few days for Spring Break, so don't expect any new blog posts until Monday or Tuesday.  Until then, take a look around the site, visit some of my <a href="http://justintadlock.com/links" title="Links To Other Sites"> links</a>, or read old posts from the <a href="http://justintadlock.com/archives" title="Archives">archives</a>.
