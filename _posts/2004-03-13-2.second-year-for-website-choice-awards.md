I'm back...I just got done finishing up my <a href="http://" title="Link No Longer Available"><del> WEBSITE CHOICE AWARDS</del></a> site.  It's in it's second year now.  You (the people) will get to vote on the best sites nominated.  Nominations are being taken for all categories at the moment.  So hurry up and get you a spot if you think your site can make it.  The website to go to is:<a href="http://" title="Link No Longer Available"><del> WEBSITE CHOICE AWARDS</del></a>.  Once again, I'm off to work on other stuff...But I'll blog in a few hours.  <em> ~greenshady</em>
