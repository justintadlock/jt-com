Wow!!! I've been up for 33 straight hours.  I'm going to go to bed soon after posting here though.  Nominate yourself in the <del> Website Choice Awards</del><ins> Link No Longer Available</ins>.  Now, I am going to continue posting this until we get some people to come nominate themselves.

And there has been no news in my personal life today (at least none that I can talk about right now).  But I'll let everyone in on what's going on soon.  <em> ~greenshady</em>

website updates:

<del>Wall of Shame</del><ins> Link No Longer Available</ins>
<del>Drawing Contest</del><ins> Link No Longer Available</ins>
