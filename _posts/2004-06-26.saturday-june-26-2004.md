know.  But I guess I've run out of excuses not to write.  Like too much school-work.  Too much actual work.  Or too much broken computer.  Those <b> DAMN</b> viruses!!!  Anyways, I have been busy with those things for real.  And plus, I haven't had much time to write about anything.  OH, GREAT NEWS!  Me and my roomy Tim got two free tickets to get into Whitewater in Georgia.  So we're going in like a month!  I haven't worked much on <a href="http://thesunnydalejournal.dark-autumn.com" title="The Sunnydale Journal" rel="enternal"> The Sunnydale Journal</a> lately either.  I have a few ideas floating around though.  I'm thinking about starting a fansite for the show <b> SMALLVILLE</b> also.  I just recently bought the first two seasons on DVD, and I'm rating it as one of my favorite shows of all time now.  I can't wait til' third season comes out, so I can catch up with what's coming on TV.  Anyways, I'd love to stay and ramble, but I'm about to work on some ideas for the new <b> SMALLVILLE </b> site I'll be making.  ~ <a href="mailto:webmaster@dark-autumn.com"> greenshady</a>
