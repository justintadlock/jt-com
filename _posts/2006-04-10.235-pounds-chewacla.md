Yes, I know that I have been lazy about writing in this little area, and that this statement is being used more frequently.  But, I have other things to do.  Like school, for instance.  Or working out.  Most of my blogging has actually went toward the <a href="http://www.bodyforlifers.com" title="Body For Lifers Website" rel="external"> Body For Lifers' Message Board</a>.  I've been giving this program my all, 100%, or 110% if you will.  I've actually lost five pounds since I last weighed, putting me at 235.

I went on a camping/hiking trip this weekend here in Auburn at Chewacla Park, or something like that.  But, I don't want to go too much into that now.  And the truth is, if I'm not writing about it now, then I probably never will.

Anyways, I've got to get some sleep.  I have loads of stuff to do this week and next for school, and I'm already behind.  I'll try to blog again tomorrow night, but I make no promises.

So, on that note, I'm off to dream dreams of three essays and one test in the next two weeks.  Ah, isn't sleep wonderful?
