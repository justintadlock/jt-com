I had a slight problem with the internet last night.  It wasn't working! So, I couldn't write on my progress, and I had a lot to say.  Unfortunately, I just about forgot it all.

<em>Day 9</em>
Basically, it was a lazy day.  I only gave, roughly, 60% - 70%.  I finished up my 6 intervals in my cardio workout, with a minute rest in between each.  Maybe, it was because I felt so sluggish all over.  I took a nap from 2:00 in the afternoon until around 6:00, waking up dreading the workout.  But I dragged through it anyway.  I suppose doing it is better than not doing it at all.

<em>Day 10</em>
Today was a better day.  I felt better to start off with anyways.  I capped off a good set of leg press, doing 12 reps (270 lbs.), 10 (360), 8 (450), 6 (540), and 24 (270).  That's when I got really tired.  That last set just wore me out.  I then proceeded to do lunges.  I done a set of 8 reps (100 lbs.), 6 (100), and 6 (100).  I just couldn't do any more.  At least I got the major muscles worked.  Really, though, the best leg workouts, standalone, are squate, leg press, or deadlift.  But, they don't like you to use free weights without a partner in the <acronym title="Student Activity Center"> ACT</acronym>.  So, there goes squats, at least.  And I'm not really big on deadlift, so I do the leg press.

Nutrition has been on key for the last couple of days.  I probably won't do bad in that area.  I pretty much love to eat anything.  Almost anything.
