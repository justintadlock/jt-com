I haven't hopped around the Web as much as I usually do every week.  I've been busy putting together a super-cool theme.  Nevertheless, I do have a few links to share.

I've also added the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3615" title="del.icio.us Bookmarks add-on for Firefox"> del.icio.us bookmarks add-on</a> for Firefox.  You can more easily follow what I'm linking to throughout the week by checking out my <a href="http://del.icio.us.com/greenshady" title="My Bookmarks"> del.icio.us bookmarks</a> instead of following my Digg, Reddit, and every other social bookmarking application in existence.

<h3>From my feed:</h3>

I don't give enough link love to the people behind my feed subscriptions.  They too often get read, then discarded.  Starting now, I will link to a few articles that I've filed away for safekeeping every week from my feed reader.

<h3>Interesting articles:</h3>

Interesting articles and videos I've found around the Net this week.

<ul>
<li><a href="http://libertyonline.hypermall.com/henry-liberty.html" title="Patrick Henry: Give Me Liberty or Give Me Death">Give Me Liberty or Give Me Death</a>
Patrick Henry's famous speech from 1775.  If you're an American and you haven't read this, stop what you're doing and read it now.  If you have read it, it wouldn't hurt to read it again.</li>
<li><a href="http://463.blogs.com/the_463/2007/10/hi-there-im-the.html" title="Hi there. I'm the Internet. I like romantic dinners, long walks on the beach and..">Internet poll on people's lives and the Internet</a>

Bill Maher is always hilarious, and he's no different in this video where he examines Halloween and the things we should be scared of.  I should start a Bill Maher weekly roundup.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other blogs and sites of interest:</h3>

Cool sites and other things that don't fit in other categories.  Don't dismiss them because they're definitely worth checking out.

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.askdanandjennifer.com" title="Ask Dan and Jennifer: Dating, Relationships, and Sex. Tips, Advice, Articles, and Videos.">Ask Dan and Jennifer</a>
This is a neat site about dating, relationships, and sex.  I absolutely love their videos.  Plus, they just recently had a redesign by <a href="http://briangardner.com" title="Brian Gardner"> Brian Gardner</a>, using his <a href="http://news.revolutiontheme.com/demo/index.php?wptheme=Revolution+Magazine" title="Revolution Magazine"> Revolution Magazine WordPress theme</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.deletedimages.com" title="Deleted Images: The Junkyard of Art">Deleted Images</a>
A showcase of images that people would normally delete from their cameras.  Some are weird, others are not worth the time looking at.  Give it a quick look through for the real beauties though.</li>
<li><a href="http://snook.ca/jonathan" title="Jonathan Snook">Snook.ca</a>
I'm not sure how I came across Jonathan Snook's site, but it's a showcase in design beauty.  This is the type of design that most of us only dream of accomplishing.  Plus, he's got a few great articles too.</li>
<li><a href="http://current.com" title="Current: Your World. Your View">Current</a>
A neat peer-to-peer network where people share their views.  The TV section is great.  You should see what some of the idiots say on there.</li>
<li><a href="http://worldofwarcraft.com/index.xml" title="World of Warcraft Community Site">World of Warcraft</a>
I've always wanted to play WoW, but never got around to it.  A monthly fee kind of scares me off because I know I wouldn't be able to put in the time to get my money's worth.  Anyone know of any good free online MMORPGs?</li>
</ul>

If you've been following my Weekly Roundup, you've obviously noticed something different, haven't you?  Yes, there are small excerpts with each link.  I'm not sure if I'll continue to do this or not, but thought I'd give it a try this week.  Obviously, the more I write about things, the less time I have to find great stuff and link to it.

It's an experiment in progress, just as the Weekly Roundup itself is an experiment.
