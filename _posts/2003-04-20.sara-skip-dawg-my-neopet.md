Well it has been a great day!  No school.  Nothing to do, cept work on the site a lil bit.  I had a fine conversation with Sara tonight.  And me and Skip Dawg did some freestyle rhyme typing exercises on yahoo messenger.  I added a new calendar, read, game, and site history today also.  So everyone go check them out.  I didn't play much with my neopet today, I had to restrain myself from that, fore' I get too addicted.  I'll prolly go see a baseball game this week sometime.  We play Arkansas tomorrow, so I might go check that out.  Hell, it's only two bucks, so i might as well.  Anyways, enjoy your stay and yadda yadda yadda.  ~greenshady
