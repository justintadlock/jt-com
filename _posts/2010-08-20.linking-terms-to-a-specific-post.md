excerpt   : "When is something both a taxonomy term and post of a specific post type?  How do we handle that scenario in WordPress?"
---

Almost every week I get asked a question about custom WordPress taxonomies and post types that has been bothering me for quite a while.  I've thought over several solutions to the question and haven't necessarily found the perfect one, but I have found one that may work in some cases.

The question usually goes back to my original post on creating a <a href="http://justintadlock.com/archives/2009/06/04/using-custom-taxonomies-to-create-a-movie-database" title="Using custom taxonomies to create a movie database">movie database with taxonomies</a>.  In the tutorial, I explain how to make several taxonomies that represent people (actor, director, producer, and writer).  Taxonomies give us a way to clearly label and organize what roles a person takes on within the production of a movie.  The relationship between the given taxonomy and the movie post type usually stops there.

The question: <em>How does one make an "actor" both a taxonomy term and a post of a specific post type?</em>

That's essentially what most of the questions boil down to.  We want the clear organizational structure of taxonomies, but we also want each term in a taxonomy to behave as if it were a post/page with the ability to edit the content, upload media, have custom fields, and allow comments.  So, we also need a "person" post type to handle this.

Creating taxonomies and post types is the easy part.  Making the connection we want is the complex part of the question.

<h2>What we're doing</h2>

In this tutorial, we're trying to make connections between two post types and one taxonomy.

<ul>
	<li>Movie (post type).</li>
	<li>Person (post type).</li>
	<li>Actor (taxonomy).</li>
</ul>

In my movie database example, we'd be making the connection with several taxonomies.  But, I want to keep this tutorial simple.

The goal is to create a "movie" and list its actors on the movie page.  But, instead of going to an actor archive when clicking on one of the actor's names, we want to visit a "person" page with custom content.  This would allow you to write custom content, upload images, add videos, open up the commenting section, and do all the things you'd normally be able to do with posts.

On the movie database, when we see Tom Hanks listed as an actor, we'd want to visit a <a href="http://popcritics.com/people/tom-hanks" title="Tom Hanks at Pop Critics">custom person page</a> we set up for him.

<h2>Post type and taxonomy setup</h2>

<p class="alert">The rest of this tutorial assumes a working knowledge of creating post types and taxonomies.  The examples below will be limited and likely won't be helpful unless you have an understanding of this process.  Please read my previous tutorials on <a href="http://justintadlock.com/archives/2010/04/29/custom-post-types-in-wordpress" title="Custom post types in WordPress">post types</a> and <a href="http://justintadlock.com/archives/2010/06/10/a-refresher-on-custom-taxonomies" title="A refresher on custom taxonomies">taxonomies</a> for a more in-depth review.</p>

Open your theme's <code>functions.php</code> file and add this <acronym title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</acronym> code to create the movie and person post types.

<pre><code>add_action( 'init', 'my_register_post_types' );

function my_register_post_types() {

	register_post_type(
		'movie',
		array(
			'public' => true,
			'labels' => array( 'name' => 'Movies', 'singular_name' => 'Movie' )
		)
	);

	register_post_type(
		'person',
		array(
			'public' => true,
			'labels' => array( 'name' => 'People', 'singular_name' => 'Person' )
		)
	);
}</code></pre>

Now, let's add some code for our actor taxonomy.

<pre><code>add_action( 'init', 'my_register_taxonomies' );

function my_register_taxonomies() {

	register_taxonomy(
		'actor',
		array( 'movie' ),
		array(
			'public' => true,
			'labels' => array( 'name' => 'Actors', 'singular_name' => 'Actor' )
		)
	);
}</code></pre>

That should give us a simple setup to work with and base to build our new functionality on.

The biggest thing to note here is that we have to be careful with our actor and person slugs.  When we create a new actor (term), we need to have the exact same slug as the person (post).  For example, when creating the Tom Hanks "actor," it needs to have the slug of <code>tom-hanks</code>.  And, when we create the Tom Hanks "person," it needs to have the slug of <code>tom-hanks</code>.  Otherwise, the proposed solutions below won't work.

<h2>Option #1: Changing term links to post permalinks</h2>

One option is to change the links to actor archives to a specific post.  We'll be working with term and post slugs in this step.  I normally don't recommend using slugs because IDs are usually best to work with.  They don't change and slugs can.  Unfortunately, connecting the terms and posts via ID isn't something we can do right now.

The code below will do this step automatically for you.  What it does is filter <code>term_link</code> (link to actor archive page).  It grabs the term slug (actor name) and searches for a post slug that matches the term slug and has a post type of "person."  If it finds the post, it switches the link for you.  Otherwise, it does nothing.

If you're listing a ton of terms on one page, this solution isn't ideal unless you mix it in with a caching solution.

<pre><code>add_filter( 'term_link', 'my_term_to_type', 10, 3 );

function my_term_to_type( $link, $term, $taxonomy ) {

	if ( 'actor' == $taxonomy ) {
		$post_id = my_get_post_id_by_slug( $term->slug, 'person' );

		if ( !empty( $post_id ) )
			return get_permalink( $post_id );
	}

	return $link;
}

function my_get_post_id_by_slug( $slug, $post_type ) {
	global $wpdb;

	$slug = rawurlencode( urldecode( $slug ) );
	$slug = sanitize_title( basename( $slug ) );

	$post_id = $wpdb->get_var( $wpdb->prepare( "SELECT ID FROM $wpdb->posts WHERE post_name = %s AND post_type = %s", $slug, $post_type ) );

	if ( is_array( $post_id ) )
		return $post_id[0];
	elseif ( !empty( $post_id ) );
		return $post_id;

	return false;
}</code></pre>

<h2>Option #2: Redirect term archives to posts</h2>

In the above example, term archives are still publicly available.  We're not doing a redirect, so it's possible for someone to still stumble upon the archive or for you to even make it available if you wanted to.  But, if you're looking for a way to redirect anyone that visits a term archive to the appropriate post, use the code below.  This method is also a lot more efficient.

Use this code in your <code>functions.php</code> file.

<pre><code>add_action( 'template_redirect', 'my_redirect_term_to_post' );

function my_redirect_term_to_post() {
	global $wp_query;

	if ( is_tax() ) {
		$term = $wp_query->get_queried_object();

		if ( 'actor' == $term->taxonomy ) {
			$post_id = my_get_post_id_by_slug( $term->slug, 'person' );

			if ( !empty( $post_id ) )
				wp_redirect( get_permalink( $post_id ), 301 );
		}
	}
}

function my_get_post_id_by_slug( $slug, $post_type ) {
	global $wpdb;

	$slug = rawurlencode( urldecode( $slug ) );
	$slug = sanitize_title( basename( $slug ) );

	$post_id = $wpdb->get_var( $wpdb->prepare( "SELECT ID FROM $wpdb->posts WHERE post_name = %s AND post_type = %s", $slug, $post_type ) );

	if ( is_array( $post_id ) )
		return $post_id[0];
	elseif ( !empty( $post_id ) );
		return $post_id;

	return false;
}</code></pre>

<h2>Asking for a term meta table</h2>

There has been some discussion in the WordPress community about adding a <a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/10142" title="Add metadata support for taxonomies">term meta table</a> to the WordPress core.  I can list a ton of reasons this would be a great idea, but let me just focus on how it would make the above solutions even better.

Right now (in the examples), we're calling up the database to search for a post based on a slug.  This isn't something I really like to do on the front end, especially with the first example.  For example, listing 50 actors on a page using the first option would cause us to search the database 50 times to see if a post slug matches the taxonomy term.

A term meta table would easily solve this problem.  We could save the post ID as metadata for individual terms.  We could even do the post lookup in the backend instead of doing it on-the-fly on the front end of the site.  Or, even provide a nice interface for easily selecting the post/term we want to connect.  Having term meta would allow us to do a quick check if there's a post we want to redirect to.

<h2>Other solutions and thoughts</h2>

The above solutions are just something I was tinkering around with because of the enormous number of questions I get about this.  I haven't fully explored every possible option, so I can't say that either is the best route to take.  Think of it more as "Justin thinking out loud" than a definite solution.

I would love to hear your take on other solutions or even solutions that we could try to get rolled into core to better handle metadata and relationships between post types and taxonomies.
