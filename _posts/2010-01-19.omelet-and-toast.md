One of my New Year's resolutions is to eat healthier.  Isn't that on all of our lists?  Another is to take more pictures.

Since I'm making an effort to do both, I thought I'd share some of the things I eat along the way.  Now for the first recipe.

Today, I got up bright and early simply because I wanted to make sure I got breakfast in.  I've had a craving for an omelet for a while.  I haven't made one in a couple of years, so this was an experiment in making sure I didn't completely burn something.

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Whole grain bread (I prefer Arnold's 12 Grain)</li>
	<li>1 whole egg</li>
	<li>3 egg whites</li>
	<li>2 Tbsp fat-free/skim milk</li>
	<li>1/3 cup of cheddar cheese (reduced-fat), shredded (I used mozzarella because I was out of cheddar)</li>
	<li>1/4 cup of lean ham or turkey, diced</li>
	<li>1/4 green bell pepper, diced</li>
	<li>1/4 red bell pepper, diced</li>
	<li>1 slice of an oninon, diced</li>
	<li>Black pepper</li>
	<li>Chili powder</li>
	<li>Ground cumin</li>
	<li>Minced garlic</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to cook the meal</h2>

First, you need to toss the whole egg (preferably without the shell), the three egg whites, milk, and black pepper into a bowl.  Whisk it until you've gotten it looking like one substance and not some weird mish-mash of foods.

While doing this, you should have a frying pan (or skillet as non-Southerners call them) warming up on medium heat.  Yes, this should be on a stove-top.

Pour your omelet mixture into the frying pan.  While waiting for the next 3-to-4 minutes for the omelet to set, toss in a sprinkle of chili powder, ground cumin, and minced garlic.  I prefer to season as desired, so there's no set measurements for seasoning.  Feel free to experiment.

Once the egg mixture is set (isn't runny on the top), add the ham, half of your cheese, green and red bell pepper, and onion onto one half of the omelet.  Take your spatula and flip the other half on top of that.  Then, sprinkle your remaining cheese across the top.

Let this set until the cheese on top starts to melt.  Also, you might want to toast that bread.

At this point, you can throw it on any type of plate you want (notice that I went with the traditional paper plate with a paper plate holder) and enjoy.

<h2>My thoughts on this recipe</h2>

The biggest mistake I made was not picking up cheddar cheese while grocery shopping yesterday.  Mozzarella just doesn't do an omelet justice.  And, I may have set the heat a bit too high at first, which is why the omelet is a little browner than I wanted and had a little breakage around the edges.

Another thing I might try next time is tossing my ham, pepper, and onion into a separate frying pan and heating them before adding them to the omelet.  I might go with a <em>real</em> plate the next time I take a picture too.

Overall, it was tasty.  But, more importantly, it was much healthier than the things I was eating every day last year.
