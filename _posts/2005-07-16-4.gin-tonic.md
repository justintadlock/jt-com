I just finished up my first bartending gig!  It actually wasn't so bad.  Most of the drinks were pretty basic.  I had the Gin &amp; Tonic, Bourbon &amp; Coke or Water, Vodka &amp; Tonic, Scotch &amp; Coke or Water, and a few other simple things.  Overall, it was pretty fun.  I came away with $35 for three-and-a-half hours, plus a $1 tip.  The people were great, especially after a few drinks.  I also tried my first, well...first two, Gin & Tonics.  One of the better drinks I've tried.  I'd say it's definitely a good thing to have on the menu at a party.  It was one of the top drinks served other than bourbon.

Well, I think it's about time for me to settle down and watch some <em> Angel: Season 5</em> on DVD.  I need to prop up my ankle that I turned earlier today.
