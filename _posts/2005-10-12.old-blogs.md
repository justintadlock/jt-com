I've started indexing my old blog files!!!  Yeah, like that's the most exciting news you've heard today.  Well, it may just be some of the most exciting news of my day.  I have blogs dating back to 2003, back when I didn't have this little nifty <a href="http://www.wordpress.org" rel="external"> Wordpress</a> package.  It definitely helps keep things under control.  Luckily wordpress allows you to change the time stamp on your posts.  So, I can go in and post, then just change the time to the time the blog was originally written.  I figured, if I index one or two of my old blogs a day, I can finish within the next year or so!  Okay, I may never get finished.  That job would get a bit to tedious for me.  But, I may get through the 2005 posts before I finally give up.  I don't know.  Only time will tell.  Lots of time.  But until then...
