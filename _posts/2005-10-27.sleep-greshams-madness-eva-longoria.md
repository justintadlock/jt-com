<i>SLEEP</i>.

It seems such a wonderful thing.  Such a thing of long-lost memories that are beyond long gone now.  If only I could get a wonderful 8 hours...Maybe even a slightly wonderful 6 hours of undisturbed, unadulterated shut-eye.

I finally caught up with my reading of Bram Stoker's <i> Dracula</i> (page 145).  Now I only have to do the reading for tomorrow.  I think Dr. Gresham has gone mad!  He expects my class to read 247 pages of this book in one week, right along with all of our other school work and actual work and social lives (assuming we do our work, we don't have any).  I did, however, finish off another great novel selected by Dr. Bolton for Contemporary British Literature, Zadie Smith's <i> White Teeth</i>.  This will definitely make it into the <a href="http://www.dark-autumn.com/bookclub"> Book Club</a> reading list, just as soon as I get a chance to update that thing.  But, if you get the chance, it's well worth the 464 pages of reading you'll have to go through.

In other news:  I had a chance this afternoon to work on a new design/theme idea.  Here's the background image I've been working on:

I said I wanted to do an Eva Longoria theme, so I'm going to do it.  It may not be ready until this weekend, but it will be ready.  This particular design should challenge my CSS skills a bit.

Anyways, I'm off to bed once again, and possibly getting 5 hours of pure, soundless...
