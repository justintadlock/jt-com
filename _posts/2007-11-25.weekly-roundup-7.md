Another week has gone by and I have another Weekly Roundup to present to you.  No, I didn't post too much in this past week, but rest assured that I worked every single day on something.  I'll give you plenty of new content in the coming weeks to be happy about.  But, for now, check out this week's roundup of noteworthy links.

<h3>Must-see:</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://myspace.com/justintadlock" title="Justin Tadlock's MySpace page">My MySpace profile</a>
Yes, I'm shamelessly linking myself this week.  I'll soon release the newest version of the <a href="http://justintadlock.com/archives/2007/02/25/make-your-myspace-profile-look-like-facebook" title="Make your MySpace profile look like Facebook"> Facebook on MySpace Theme</a>.  The old version is, well, old.  Look for version 2.0 in the coming days.</li>
</ul>

<h3>WordPress:</h3>

Your weekly dosage of WordPress goodies and news.  There are definitely some interesting sites you should check out this week.

If only I had thought of this idea first.  It sounds like a good read.  I have so many WordPress tutorials and articles bookmarked now, that I'm not sure if I need a copy.  I might still purchase one for reference though.</li>
<li><a href="http://welovewp.com" title="We Love WP">We Love WP</a>

<li><a href="http://wpthemez.com" title="WP Themez: Top WordPress Themes">WP Themez</a>
This is a Digg-like site for WordPress themes.  It could become pretty popular soon.  I'm trying to do my part in seeing that happen.  Go vote for my <a href="http://www.wpthemez.com/story.php?title=Visionary_A_quality_WordPress_theme_for_news_and_magazine-style_sites_or_blogs" title="Visionary theme at WP Themez"> Visionary theme</a> while you're checking it out.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Design:</h3>

Only one article this week, but it's well worth the read.

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/understandingwebdesign" title="Understanding Web Design">Understanding Web Design</a>
A great article by Jeffrey Zeldman on Web design.  He talks about what Web design is and is not.  He also argues that many of the leaders on the Web do not understand what makes good Web design because they don't essentially understand the Web.</li>
</ul>
