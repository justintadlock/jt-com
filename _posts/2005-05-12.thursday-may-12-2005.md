I guess I need to be going to bed...oh...say...like 3 hours ago.  I'll never learn. I got so wrapped up in playing <i> NCAA</i> and <i> Madden</i> that I forgot to watch tonight's episode of <b> Smallville</b>.  Now, I won't even be able to see it before the season finale next Wednesday. Cut to: a few hours later.  Here I am, sitting on the computer looking at different websites and such.  I lost my website interest for a few days, then I suddenly get it back at 12:00 am, just in time for me to go to bed.  That's insane troll logic! Anyways, I updated <a href="http://www.dark-autumn.com/people/justin_tadlock/articles/dvds.php"> this</a> the other day for some reason.  It's my <a href="http://www.dark-autumn.com/people/justin_tadlock/articles/dvds.php"> DVD Collection</a>.  It features my <acronym title="Digital Video Discs"> DVD</acronym> movie collection, my television box set collection, and my illegally downloaded movie collection.  Yep, it's all <a href="http://www.dark-autumn.com/people/justin_tadlock/articles/dvds.php"> right here</a>.  Anyways, on that note, I'm off to bed...
