Hi!!!  Oh so avid readers...  Or shall I say Long Gone Avid Readers.  Wow!  It's been a long time since I've been able to write.  Computer problems, plus not having much time to hit up the library for their computers.  Hopefully I've gotten everything fixed.  But just to let anyone know that happens to stumble across this spec on the net, I'm pretty much 'reopening' the site now.  So I'll definitely be doing some big time reinventing and cleaning up of this site.  I'm not sure what the new look will be like, but it should be up and running very soon.  As a matter of fact, I'm going to run over some new ideas right now...  So Chow...

Okay... I'm back now...  I've worked on a few ideas for the site.  And now, I've rearranged all my pages into different files...  So for the time being, a lot of the links aren't going to work.  But I've got to get some sleep, so I'll get on that tomorrow.  But sign the book if you have any ideas or whatever...
Buh-Bye!
