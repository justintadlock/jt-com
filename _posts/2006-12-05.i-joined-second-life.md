I joined <a href="http://secondlife.com" title="Second Life: Your World. Your Imagination" rel="external"> Second Life</a> tonight.  I haven't gotten a chance to install the software yet, so I haven't played the game.  What do you think of virtual networking communities and their effects on society?
