Day eight.  Such a magical day.  Well, it should be.  But, it was one of the toughest days yet.  After putting in 5 grueling hours of yardwork and about a gallon-and-a-half of water, I headed home.  I ate a peach and 2 pieces of string cheese.  Then I headed off to Wal-Mart to buy myself a set of 10 lb. dumbells to aid in my upper body training.

So, I got a little downtime before my workout, but it was rough.  I felt like I was lagging a bit, but I also felt like I had nothing left to give.  I still got a good workout in, although, I think I could've pushed myself a little harder.

One rule I used to always follow is:

<blockquote class="quote">
"On your bad days, the days you don't particularly feel like working out, give it everything you got and then some.  Because the bad days are when you actually improve yourself.  Then on the good days, the days when you feel like you could move a mountain, it'll be a breeze."
</blockquote>

It's a rule I should always follow, and maybe my avid readers should take note.  And this is not something that you should follow just when you're working out, it's something that should help carry you through all walks of life.
