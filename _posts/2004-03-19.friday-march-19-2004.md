Well, it's later now.  Or early in the morning.  Yeah, I'm an insomniac.  Anyways, my sister's beauty pageant is tonight at like 7:00.  So, I'm going to have to go home (like an hour and a half drive) to go see that.  I'm probably not going to be updating or blogging until Sunday night.  Unless I get to later today.  I'm just so busy usually.  But I promise, PROMISE to get some information that you could definitely live without to post up here by Sunday.  Anyways, here's to signing off useless information 1o1:  <em> ~greenshady</em>
