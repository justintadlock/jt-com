Yes, I suppose I'll be helping with the fight against autism pretty soon.  I am being brought on to develop a website for the cause.  I'm not totally sure on all details just yet, but I'll keep them posted.  The person who I'm developing this website for holds her own spot at <a href="http://www.blog-city.com" rel="external"> Blog City</a>.  So go check out <a href="http://www.slatersjourney.blog-city.com" rel="external"> Slater's Journey</a> and show your support.
