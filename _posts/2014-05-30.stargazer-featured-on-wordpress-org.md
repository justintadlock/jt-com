I'm happy to announce that my Stargazer theme was put on the WordPress.org <a href="http://wordpress.org/themes" title="WordPress.org WordPress themes">featured themes list</a> today.  It's nice to see others appreciate your work once in a while.  Thank you to whoever chose to feature it.

Also, if you haven't seen it yet, I've redesigned the <a href="http://themehybrid.com/themes/stargazer">Stargazer theme page</a> over at Theme Hybrid.  Feedback is welcome.
