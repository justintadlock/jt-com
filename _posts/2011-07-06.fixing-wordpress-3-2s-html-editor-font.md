One of the coolest things about WordPress 3.2 is its "distraction-free writing" mode. I've been eagerly awaiting using this feature on my own sites for months. Unfortunately, WordPress 3.2 also shipped with a font change for the <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> editor to a monospace font, which isn't so distraction free when you're trying to write.

Sure, I could switch over to the visual editor, but I hate the visual editor more than I hate people who kill kittens for fun. I haven't used it in at least four years and will likely not be switching over any time soon.

There is a growing group of people who would like to <a title="Return the HTML editor back to a sans font" href="http://wordpress.org/extend/ideas/topic/return-the-html-editor-back-to-a-sans-font-instead-of-the-new-consolas-font">see the font reverted</a>. However, Matt Thomas does have a <a title="Monospace font in the HTML post editor" href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/17640#comment:10">reasonable argument</a> for the change to a monospace font.

Let's not focus on the argument over what fonts to use though. WordPress makes this extremely easy to change. It only takes a few lines of code.

<h2>How to change the font</h2>

In your theme's <code>functions.php</code> file or in a plugin file, add the following lines of code to change the font stack.

<pre><code>add_action( 'admin_head-post.php', 'my_fix_html_editor_font' );
add_action( 'admin_head-post-new.php', 'my_fix_html_editor_font' );

function my_fix_html_editor_font() { ?&gt;
&lt;style type="text/css"&gt;#editorcontainer #content, #wp_mce_fullscreen { font-family: Georgia, "Times New Roman", "Bitstream Charter", Times, serif; }&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;?php }</code></pre>

This will give you a font stack of:
<ul>
	<li>Georgia</li>
	<li>Times New Roman</li>
	<li>Bitstream Charter</li>
	<li>Times</li>
	<li>serif</li>
</ul>

You are, of course, free to change this font to whatever you want. I'm about to play around with my font size and line height a bit to make the writing experience even more enjoyable.

<h2>What the change looks like</h2>

The original font will look like the following screenshot.

The new look, using the code from above, will look like the next screenshot.
