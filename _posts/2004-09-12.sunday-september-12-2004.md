Hello All...I know my writing has been only here and there lately, but I get really busy with school and work so much that I don't have much time for anything else.  Oh, and watching <i> Angel</i> the Fourth Season on DVD, for the last week, took up some time too.  But I'm trying to get back into the flow of things.  I've been working on a new <a href="/forum" title="Website Forum" rel="external"> message board</a> lately.  But it's up and running and ready to go.  There are plenty of topics to talk about in there.  So go get yourself signed up for it and become a user.  The next big project I've been working on has been <a href="/films/a/APieceOfMyEternalLife" title="Now Called A Piece Of My Eternal Life"> the highland project</a>.  It's a film that I'm shooting for The Movie Gallery Student Video Competition.  And hopefully it will become a finalist and get judged at the Jay Sanders Film Festival, held right here at our Hotel & Dixon Conference Center in Auburn.  The webpage for it isn't quite up and running yet.  It's still under some construction, but I'm working on it.  Anyways, I've got to work on a few things now, so I'll come back and ramble away some other time...  <a href="mailto:webmaster@dark-autumn.com"> ~greenshady</a>
