Hello World!  This will be my first official blog here my website <a href="http://www.dark-autumn.com" title="Home Page"> www.DARK-AUTUM.com</a>!  Yay for me!  Like anyone actually reads this stuff...I just got up like an hour ago, so I'm still fairly sleepy.  I've transferred my other two sites over here:  <a href="/thesunnydalejournal" title="The Sunnydale Journal" rel="external"> The Sunnydale Journal</a> & <a href="/websitechoiceawards" title="Website Choice Awards" rel="external">  The People's Website Choice Awards</a>.  Everything should be under full swing by the end of the week.  Hopefully there isn't any broken links or anything.  If there is just let me know by <a href="mailto:webmaster@dark-autumn.com"> email</a>. Anyways, I don't have much to say at the moment.  I've got to get to work on a few more things.  But until you read this useless blog again...Farewell...  <em> ~greenshady</em>
