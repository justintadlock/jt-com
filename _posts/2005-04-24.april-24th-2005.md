Yes. A new look. I was going to completely redo everything and just get rid of my iframe. But, I thought about it a while, and decided that the iframe was part of my look. There's so many people not using it anymore and just including the header and footer with every page. That's just not my look. I'd rather have faster load times for each individual page with the iframe. It's more effecient as far as time goes. And, plus, I wouldn't have to completely redo the whole site.

Anyways, it's just been another long, long day. And it's turned into a long, long night. I've done some yard work this morning, finished watching King of the Hill: Season 1 on DVD, and fixed up this site a little bit. All without ever starting to write on my World Literature II paper that's due on Thursday, nor doing my German homework that's due on Monday.

I know. I know. I need to get to going with some of that stuff. But, I just felt that the website was a pressing matter that needed to get taken care of. There's still some things that need updating. I have a few things in mind about the site structure and everything. It might just take some time. Although, I'm going to get started on some of that stuff right after I finish off this blog. So, until next timeâ€¦
