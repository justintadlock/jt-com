I don't know what it is.  Maybe I'm bored.  Maybe I'm depressed.  I'm just in that mood where I want to want again; but, somehow, I can't seem to put my self in the place that I need to be.  I would like to say I can change my life tomorrow.  Yes, on a Monday.  Who knows how I'll feel in the morning though?

So, my spirits are down a little.  Mostly, it's probably just stress from school.  I'm a bit burnt out right now.  I need to finish this semester out strong.  Maybe that second wind'll hit me when I wake up.  I know I simply have to get back in the right mindset, but I never have control over that.  Motivation seems to come at me in these rare bursts, and then it burns out quickly.  I do get some great work done during these motivational highs.  But, when I come down, I crash hard.

I suppose what I am asking is, "Please, please let me get on one of my motivational highs, and ride it out for the rest of the semester.  At least give me that much."  God, The Powers That Be, Mother Universe, Whoever.  Let me have this.
