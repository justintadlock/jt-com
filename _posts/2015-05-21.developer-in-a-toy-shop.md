I'm always excited when WordPress adds a new feature.  The first thing I do is try to extend it in some way to do something even more awesome.  It doesn't even matter if I have a particular need for the feature.  I'm like a kid in a toy shop, playing around with all the new stuff.  I've always assumed other devs were the same way, but it has been made clear to me that's not always the case.
