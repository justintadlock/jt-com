Well....Here it is...My Dawn layout. It's something new anyways.  I've got to keep the Buffy spirit alive somehow.  At least until May 25, when the "Buffy the Vampire Slayer: Season 6" comes out on DVD.  I actually just got through watching the end of "Angel: Season 1" tonight.  So, I'm really bored.  And I'm actually just blogging to fill in empty space here.  Because I put all the <a href="http://" title="Link No Longer Available"><del> old blog</del></a> up in another file.  It was taking up too much space on my the front page here.  Anyways, hopefully, I'll get something useful to tell all the avid readers soon.  But until then...So Long...  <em> ~greenshady</em>
