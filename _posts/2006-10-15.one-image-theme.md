Another weekend gone by, and I almost have absolutely nothing to show for it.  I did manage to accomplish one thing that I've been planning to do for weeks though.  I have a <a href="/skins/style.php?set=21" title="One Image Theme"> new theme</a>.  I named it <a href="/skins/style.php?set=21" title="One Image Theme"> One Image</a> because I wanted to put my CSS skills to a test and forget about using a lot of images.  Plus, I wanted a theme that would load fast on any connection.  Now, if I could only get around to cleaning up the rest of the site...

In other news, I went to the fourth quarter of the Auburn/Florida game.  I just decided in the third quarter that I was going to make it to see Auburn pull off the win.  And we did just that.  27 - 17.  Yeah, it was exciting and all that.

I'm still inching my way through Richard Russo's <i> Empire Falls</i>.  I should be finished with it by the end of the week, since I only read it between classes.  I should start putting in a little extra reading time at home with these longer novels because I have a lot on my reading list that I've got to get to.

Once again, I'm signing off this blog.  Until the next time the mood hits me...
