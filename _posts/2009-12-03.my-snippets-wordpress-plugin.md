excerpt   : "The <em>My Snippets</em> plugin gives you a meta box that allows you to control widget content on a post-by-post basis."

One of my favorite plugins has always been <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/widget-logic" title="Widget Logic WordPress plugin">Widget Logic</a>, which allows you to display/hide widgets based on context.  The biggest limitation of that plugin to me is that I had to go to my <em>Widgets</em> screen in my WordPress admin every time I wanted to add a new widget for a single post or page.

What I wanted was something that allowed me to control widget content from the post editor, so I wouldn't have to worry about setting my widgets.  This gave me the idea for the <em>My Snippets</em> plugin.

What this plugin does is add an extra meta box on the post editor that allows you to input custom content.  This content is then displayed using the <em>Snippet</em> widget in any widget area you choose.

<h2>How the plugin works</h2>

First, you'd add the <em>Snippet</em> widget to the widget area of your choosing.  You'll need that to display your custom snippets.

When writing a post (or page), you'll have an extra meta box labeled <em>Snippet Post Settings</em>.  In this box, you can add text, <acronym title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</acronym>, and shortcodes.

Here's an example of adding a video snippet:

<img src="http://justintadlock.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/snippet-settings.png" alt="Snippet post settings" title="Snippet post settings" width="600" height="217" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2226" />

Here's the output of the snippet, which will only be displayed on the singular view of the post/page I added it to:

<img src="http://justintadlock.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/snippet-widget.png" alt="Output of the Snippet widget" title="Output of the Snippet widget" width="600" height="207" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2227" />

Don't be fooled by the example though.  You can add pretty much anything in your snippet meta box, so feel free to go wild.
