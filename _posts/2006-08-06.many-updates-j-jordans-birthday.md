I've been on a bit of a website update rampage as of late.  I finally got off of my lazy butt and blogged the other day.  That, in turn, led to me sifting through piles of endless code for days on end.  Therefore, I haven't blogged since then.  But, I have been doing some major work to the site.  Here's a few of the things I have accomplished:

- New Theme: <a href="/skins/style.php?set=20" title="Samford Hall Theme"> Samford Hall</a>
- Updated Theme: <a href="/skins/style.php?set=7" title="You're Welcome Theme"> You're Welcome</a>
- Updated Theme: <a href="/skins/style.php?set=4" title="A Buffy Layout Theme"> A Buffy Layout</a>
- <a href="/skins" title="View All Themes For This Site">Updated Skins/Themes/Design Page</a>
- <a href="/art" title="View My Artwork">Updated Art Page</a>
- Added some new essays to the <a href="/literature" title="Literature"> Literature Page</a>
- Tweaked almost all of my <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets"> CSS</acronym> files

As you can see, I've done quite a bit of work on the site in the last few days.  I'm even thinking of adding a photography section.  I just have to plan out a good filing system before I dive right into that one.  Anytime I add a new file these days, I try to carefully plan for the future.  That way, I won't be stuck with updating every file and directory when I do add updates to the site.

I understand that this is probably painfully boring to read, but it's all I have to talk about really.

I guess I could give a shout-out to my best friend in the entire world right now.  It's his 21st birthday today.  So, happy birthday <a href="http://www.myspace.com/94194326" title="Jonathan's MySpace Page" rel="external"> Jonathan</a>.

Until next time...
