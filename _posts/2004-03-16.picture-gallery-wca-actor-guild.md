I didn't get to go to class this morning...I couldn't find the key to my car.  Kind of sucks, cause we were having a test review today.  That would've been easy, and I would've learned something.  Oh well...

I added a <del> PICTURE GALLERY</del><ins> Link No Longer Available</ins> today.  So go check that out.  I also changed the nominating form on the <del> WEBSITE CHOICE AWARDS</del><ins> Link No Longer Available</ins>.  Go NOMINATE yourself now!  I've had <b> 18</b> people sign the guestbook since I first posted the awards.  Not a single one of those <b> 18</b> people have signed up for an award.  I'm starting to wonder if people even look around any on my website.  If you don't, then don't bother signing the guestbook.  See?  Simple, Isn't It?  <em>  ~greenshady</em>
