Almost bed time.  Well...I should've been in bed about an hour and forty-one minutes ago.  But who's counting.  I've been way too lazy these last few days.  And when I say lazy, I mean just lying-in-bed-sitting-behind-the-computer-for-hours-on-end kind of lazy.  I've got plenty of work done on the website, but not much else in the way of other things.  Like the 5 sections of German homework that I've yet to even look at.  I did manage to scribble down a page, one page that is, of my World Literature II paper.  That makes for a total of three pages.  Only 2 more to go before I start editing and rewriting and all that other stuff that comes along with writing a well-thought essay.  But, enough about school.  I did find a super cool trailer for Joss Whedon's new movie, <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/universal/serenity/index.html" rel="external"> Serenity</a> today.  You should check that out.  Anyways, I'm off to bed.  Until next time...
