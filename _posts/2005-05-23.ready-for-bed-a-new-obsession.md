Yes, I have a new obsession.  Printing out my art on <acronym title="Hewlett Packard">hp</acronym> premium plus glossy photo paper.  I just can't help myself.  I printed out 2 pictures tonight, and had to make myself stop doing it.  What I need to do is get back to working on my films.  I just can't motivate myself to turn on the camera and just shoot.

Anyways, I got a nice red tanline from just above my elbow about halfway up the rest of my arm today, from riding in my car about 3 hours.  I had to go home for my stepmom's birthday party and pick up my car (it's been in the shop this week).  The whole family was there.  Well, at least our immediate, whole family.  My sisters <a href="http://amynrussell.com" title="Amy's Website" rel="external"> Amy Nicole</a>, Amy Michelle (her husband and 2 kids), Sonya (plus husband and 1 kid), and my dad.  Oh, and of course, my stepmom.  Good times were to be had and all that good stuff.  I don't want to bore you with the details.  But, with all the driving, I landed me a nice red tan on one arm.

Yep, it's official, this is the worst post ever, but I'm just trying to keep blogging.  I have to go back to working tomorrow.  Bummer.
