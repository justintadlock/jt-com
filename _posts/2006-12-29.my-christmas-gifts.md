Okay, so I'm a few days late on blogging.  I was supposed to be back on here Tuesday listing out all the wonderful Christmas gifts that I got.  But, I'm simply lazy.  I've spent the last three days playing with my gifts as opposed to telling the world about them.

I will say that going home was fun, and I did get lots of neat stuff.  And since I'm not going to tell about every detail of every thing that I got, I will list the books and movies.  Especially since these are the things that will shape my life.
