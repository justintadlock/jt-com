Once again, another loooong Thursday.  I didn't get home until 5:00. Again.  I think I done well on my Biology test this morning.  I'm thinking, at least a B.  School just seems to be draining every ounce of life I have in me.  I didn't have much time to do anything else after school.  I searched the internet a while, then I had to watch television.  <i> The O.C.</i> was on.  I rather enjoyed the episode.  Then came <i> Point Pleasant</i>, in which I was pleasantly pleased with the direction the show seems to be taking.  And to not talk about this so much now, you can always read my reviews of the episodes in the <a href="http://forum.dark-autumn.com" title="The Website Forum" rel="external""> Forum</a>.  So please join now, so I can have people to talk about things with.  JOIN THE <a href="http://forum.dark-autumn.com" title="The Website Forum" rel="external"> FORUM</a>!!!  I wanted to make that a little bigger.  Maybe it'll get somebody's attention.  Well...I don't feel much like blogging tonight, so I'm going to mosey off to bed pretty soon...

<em>Updates...</em>Of course, with such a busy day, it didn't leave much time for updating this ol' ragged website.  But, I did manage to update the <a href="http://www.dark-autumn.com/site/calendar/February2005Calendar.php"><del> Calendar</del></a>.  So, if you want to know what's going on in my world, go check it out...
