I've been peeking around the market for a new cell phone lately.  I have service with Cingular, and I've narrowed my choices down to the <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone" title="View iPhone's Details" rel="external"> Apple iPhone</a>, <a href="http://www.cingular.com/cell-phone-service/cell-phone-details/?q_list=true&q_phoneName=Samsung+BlackJack&q_sku=sku300002" title="View BlackJack's Details" rel="external"> Samsung BlackJack</a>, and the <a href="http://www.cingular.com/cell-phone-service/cell-phone-details/?q_list=true&q_phoneName=Palm+Treo+680&q_sku=sku180002" title="View Palm Treo 680's Details" rel="external"> Palm Treo 680</a>.

I've been so out of touch with certain parts of the technological world lately that I can't decide on a phone.

<h5>Apple iPhone</h5>

Obviously, Apple's iPhone won't be out for a few months, but I might wait for it.  The biggest downside there is price.  However, by the time it's released I'll have graduated from Auburn, and I hope to have a decent enough job not to worry about cost.  What capabilities I do understand seem pretty exciting.  I'm definitely leaning toward this phone right now, but I don't know if I should wait it out.

</ul>

<h5 class="clearFloats">Samsung BlackJack</h5>

Before I knew that the rumors of the iPhone were true, I was looking at Samsung's BlackJack.  What really caught my eye with this phone is its design, weight, and dimensions.  However, its screen size is nonexistent compared to the iPhone.  I wish it had a at least a 2 MP camera and more than 64 MB of storage space.  I want this phone because of its aesthetics more than anything (of course, the iPhone looks great too).

</ul>

<h5 class="clearFloats">Palm Treo 680</h5>

I hadn't really thought about getting a Palm Treo until I saw one at the Cingular store the other day.  It seems to be about as good as the BlackJack as far as the specs go, but not quite as pretty.  I have heard some good things about this phone from others, so I'm keeping it on the list as I research.

</ul>

I didn't list all of the details of each phone because that would've taken up way too much space.  I'm at a loss as to what I should buy right now.  Should I wait for the iPhone until June?  I might be simply pulled in by the hype surrounding it right now, but I think it will be revolutionary.

My $45 Sony Ericsson from Wal-Mart isn't cutting it anymore.  It's good for calling people, except that you're not supposed to put your finger over this green bump on the back because it's the antenna.

I'm looking for a phone that will last at least a two years.  I'm not sure what kind of work I'll be doing once I graduate, but it will probably be journalism.  If that's the case, then I'll need the ability to send things over the Web while on the go.  I want to listen to music, but that's not a priority.  A decent camera phone would be ideal, but since I have a 8.2 MP camera, it'll be hard to look at anything less.

I want an all-in-one package.  I want a cheap all-in-one package.  Since, that's not exactly happening right now, I want at least the next best thing.

Which would you choose, and why? Or, would you take another route altogether.
