excerpt   : 'A solution for handling the "chat" post format in WordPress themes that allows for more than two speakers.'
---

This is the first post in a series of handling post formats for theme developers.  Throughout the series, I plan to offer solutions for more standardization between themes for handling post formats.  This series will not be a complete guide on using this feature, but I hope it at least gives theme developers some neat ideas on implementing post formats in a portable fashion.

In this first post of a series on handling post formats for theme developers, I'd like to present to you an option for formatting the "chat" post format.

<h2>The chat post format</h2>

Since all WordPress post formats are a part of a standard, we should look at WordPress.org's definition for the "chat" <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Formats" title="WordPress Codex: Post Formats">post format</a>:

> <strong>chat</strong> - A chat transcript, like so:

```
John: foo
Mary: bar
John: foo 2
```

That's pretty simple.  As theme developers, we should expect the chat text to be entered into the post content editor in that manner.

<h2>The forming of a solution</h2>

<a href="http://turtlepod.org" title="David Chandra's Web site">David Chandra</a> started an interesting discussion on the <a href="http://themehybrid.com" title="Theme Hybrid">Theme Hybrid</a> support forums that led to an awesome collaboration of code.

Before we really got started on the code, there was one major feature I wanted to see handled before calling it a "solution":  <strong>We must allow more than two speakers</strong>.  Most of the solutions I'd seen for chats only handled two speakers (for example, alternating paragraph colors with <abbr title="Cascading Stylesheets">CSS</abbr>).  I wanted to be able to have 100s of speakers, each with their own unique classes for styling in a theme.  It makes sense, right?  Not all chats are between two speakers.

David went to work hashing out a solution.  Honestly, he did all the dirty work.  I just cleaned it up and put it in a pretty package.

<h2>The final output</h2>

The following is a screenshot of a demo I put together for this feature with a little styling thrown in.  As you can see, it has multiple speakers, each with a custom color to differentiate them.

<h2>The code</h2>

The following is the final <abbr title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr> code we came up with for copying to a theme's <code>functions.php</code> file.

```
/* Filter the content of chat posts. */
add_filter( 'the_content', 'my_format_chat_content' );

/* Auto-add paragraphs to the chat text. */
add_filter( 'my_post_format_chat_text', 'wpautop' );

/**
 * This function filters the post content when viewing a post with the "chat" post format.  It formats the
 * content with structured HTML markup to make it easy for theme developers to style chat posts.  The
 * advantage of this solution is that it allows for more than two speakers (like most solutions).  You can
 * have 100s of speakers in your chat post, each with their own, unique classes for styling.

Feel free to break this and build from it.  If it's not a complete solution for you, it should at least be a good starting point.

<h2>How to add text to chat posts</h2>

Following the example from WordPress.org, you'd enter your chat transcript directly in the post content editor like so:

```
John: foo

Mary: bar This is an example of a WordPress page, you could edit this to put information about yourself or your site so readers know where you are coming from.

John: foo 2 What: is: this:

Smith: Aye, matey!

Joe: Huh?

Mary: bar 2
```

You can also post it without the spaces between each speaker.  I just prefer it the above way for readability.

<h2>How chat posts are formatted</h2>

Given the above example, you'd get the following output in your <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> source code.

```
&lt;div id="chat-transcript-562" class="chat-transcript">
	&lt;div class="chat-row chat-speaker-1">
		&lt;div class="chat-author chat-author-john vcard">&lt;cite class="fn">John&lt;/cite>:&lt;/div>
		&lt;div class="chat-text">&lt;p>foo&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
	&lt;/div>&lt;!-- .chat-row -->
	&lt;div class="chat-row chat-speaker-2">
		&lt;div class="chat-author chat-author-mary vcard">&lt;cite class="fn">Mary&lt;/cite>:&lt;/div>
		&lt;div class="chat-text">&lt;p>bar This is an example of a WordPress page, you could edit this to put information about yourself or your site so readers know where you are coming from.&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
	&lt;/div>&lt;!-- .chat-row -->
	&lt;div class="chat-row chat-speaker-1">
		&lt;div class="chat-author chat-author-john vcard">&lt;cite class="fn">John&lt;/cite>:&lt;/div>
		&lt;div class="chat-text">&lt;p>foo 2 What: is: this:&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
	&lt;/div>&lt;!-- .chat-row -->
	&lt;div class="chat-row chat-speaker-3">
		&lt;div class="chat-author chat-author-smith vcard">&lt;cite class="fn">Smith&lt;/cite>:&lt;/div>
		&lt;div class="chat-text">&lt;p>Aye, matey!&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
	&lt;/div>&lt;!-- .chat-row -->
	&lt;div class="chat-row chat-speaker-4">
		&lt;div class="chat-author chat-author-joe vcard">&lt;cite class="fn">Joe&lt;/cite>:&lt;/div>
		&lt;div class="chat-text">&lt;p>Huh?&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
	&lt;/div>&lt;!-- .chat-row -->
	&lt;div class="chat-row chat-speaker-2">
		&lt;div class="chat-author chat-author-mary vcard">&lt;cite class="fn">Mary&lt;/cite>:&lt;/div>
		&lt;div class="chat-text">&lt;p>bar 2&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
	&lt;/div>&lt;!-- .chat-row -->
&lt;/div>&lt;!-- .chat-transcript -->
```

<h2>Styling chats</h2>

As you can see from the previous section, the source code gives you quite a few ways to style things:

```
/* Wrapper for entire chat transcript. */
.chat-transcript { }

/* Individual section of the chat. */
.chat-row { }

/* Individual speaker in the chat. */
.chat-speaker-xxx { }

/* Chat author. */
.chat-author { }
.chat-author cite { }

/* Chat text. */
.chat-text { }
```

There are some other useful classes and IDs to use from the code, but these would be the most common for styling.

<h2>Actually use chat transcripts</h2>

One of the post formats that theme developers tend to shy away from is the chat format.  There've been no great solutions in the past, so I hope this helps in implementing something that's useable for you in theme development.  Please feel free to tinker with this code, break it, and send me fixes/enhancements you'd like to see thrown in.

Also, be sure to thank David Chandra for getting me started on this.  And, check out his theme site, <a href="http://genbutheme.com/" title="Genbu WordPress theme">Genbu Theme</a> (he's redeveloping the theme to use my <a href="http://themehybrid.com/hybrid-core" title="Hybrid Core WordPress theme framework">Hybrid Core</a> framework).
