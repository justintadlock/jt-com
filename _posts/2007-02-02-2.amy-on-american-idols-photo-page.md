I just received an email from my uncle, David Tadlock, who sent out a picture of my sister Amy.  This was from when she tried out for American Idol in Memphis.  Unfortunately, she didn't make it.

Maybe next year.

She is the girl sitting on the right.  That is one of her friends sitting next to her (I'll leave her unnamed).  Amy said she had a wonderful experience.  However, the judges only gave her a few seconds to show her talents before pushing her aside.  She has a great voice though.

You can always go check out her site, <a href="http://amynrussell.com" title="Amy's Website" rel="external"> Amy N Russell</a>.  I know she has at least one song on there you can listen to.

Also, the <a href="http://www.americanidol.com/photos/view/?set=113&seq=109" title="American Idol Photos" rel="external"> American Idol Photo Link</a>.  Can't forget to credit them.
