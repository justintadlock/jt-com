<strong>I Wanna Be An October Cold Front</strong>

I wanna blow wind gusts
In children's inner lobes,
I wanna make fire crackle and smoke
Fly out the roof, boil hot cocoa on the stove
I wanna brown leaves
Leaving stains, after it rains, on the patio,
I wanna harden snot bubbles in nostrils,
Redden eyes and clog throats.

Okay.  Okay.  Maybe not my best work.  But, I'm a little ticked off at the cold front coming through.  I believe it's making me a little sick.  Anyways, I'm going to bed at a record time tonight, just as soon as I finish up this little blog.
