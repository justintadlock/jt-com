And Bla Bla Bla.  My mind has been completely drained.  Maybe I just need a week of good, solid rest.

I've almost made the site completely<acronym title="eXtensible Hypertext Markup Language"> XHTML</acronym>.  That's right.  And I've cleaned out some of the <acronym title="Hypertext Preprocessor"> PHP</acronym> involved with integrating the <a href="http://www.wordpress.org" title="Wordpress Website" rel="external"> Wordpress</a> into my site.  I think the code runs a little faster, now that I can tell it exactly where to go instead of it running through a gazillion things.

Anyways, my novel for <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org" title="National Novel Writing Month Website" rel="external"> National Novel Writing Month</a> is not going so good right now.  I have some ideas, I just can't seem to get it going (the writing part).  I've put out about 700 words the last 2 nights in a row, whereas I needed about 11,000.

(11,000 words) - (1,400 words) = 9,600 words

Yeah, quite a few words short, if you ask me.  My goal was to get on up to 20,000 words by the end of the weekend, and that didn't quite work out.  Anyways, I'm off to bed.  Got a big day of school, work, more work, homework, and novel writing coming up tomorrow.  So, until I type down some more useless stuff on this little corner of the web, so long...
