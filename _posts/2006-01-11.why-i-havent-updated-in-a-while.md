Yeah, yeah.  I know I haven't written in a while, and tonight isn't going to be much different.  I just wanted my readers to know that I'm still alive.  I've just been so busy with moving and Christmas, and now school just started back.  It'll take me a few days to get back into the swing of things.  I will continue blogging as soon as I can get my life organized a bit.  But, until then...well, I'll never get my life organized.
