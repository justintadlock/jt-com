I'll be doing a live <abbr title="Ask Me Anything">AMA</abbr> (Ask Me Anything) on <a href="http://wpchat.com">WPChat</a> later today at 7 p.m. EST (UTC -05:00).  That's when the main event happens.  However, it will be kept open for another 24-36 hours for people from different time zones.  You can read more about it on the <a href="https://wpchat.com/t/announcing-wpchat-amas-and-our-first-guest/571/7">WPChat Thread</a>.
