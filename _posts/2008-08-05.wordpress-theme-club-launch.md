I told you I'd have a new theme club sometime or another, didn't I?

Well, here it is &mdash; <a href="http://themehybrid.com" title="Theme Hybrid"> ThemeHybrid.com</a>

<a href="http://themehybrid.com" title="Theme Hybrid: A WordPress theme club"><img src="http://justintadlock.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/theme-hybrid-themes.png" alt="Theme Hybrid" title="Theme Hybrid" height="150" class="aligncenter center size-full wp-image-977" /></a>

This thing has been months in the making, and I'm happy to announce the launch of the new site.

Theme Hybrid is all about the WordPress community.  And, I believe we'll have a lot of fun with it.

<h3>New themes?</h3>

Well, there's one new theme and a whole lotta' updates!

I've been busily working on updates for the Options, Structure, and Visionary themes, so you should have some cool, new stuff to play around with.

I have a few things coming soon too that I think you all will like.

<h3>I want to thank...</h3>

everyone that's been involved up to this point.  Theme Hybrid has been entirely paid for through user contributions, which I definitely appreciate.  So, we have hosting for the next year.

I also want to tell <a href="http://themeshaper.com" title="Ian Stewart of Theme Shaper"> Ian Stewart</a> thanks for really expanding on the ideas behind WordPress and for doing more than his fair share of work by pushing me to think creatively with themes.

Then there's <a href="http://www.f1racing.dk" title="Reinar Svendsen"> Reinar Svendsen</a> who helped out with some user testing, helping make sure the site was running.

Without everyone's support in the last couple of months with the project, I would definitely be much further behind than I am now.

<h3>Things to look forward to</h3>

I won't go into too many details at the moment.  You can read the <a href="http://themehybrid.com/archives/2008/08/welcome-to-theme-hybrid" title="Theme Hybrid WordPress theme club release post"> welcome post</a> on the new site for more in-depth information.

I will say that I'm pretty excited about everything.  I have quite a few theme projects I'll be looking to bring out in the next few months.

The things you can really look forward to are a rethinking of how we use WordPress themes and how we're going to reshape the WordPress theme market to something entirely new.

So, go check out <a href="http://themehybrid.com" title="Theme Hybrid"> the new site</a> already!
