Here I am, again.  I know, it's been almost three weeks now.  I've been really busy though.  I've been packing up getting ready to move out of this apartment and into a trailer with my sister and roomate.  Which they'll be getting married August 14.  I'll be leaving for Ohio, to visit my aunt, this Saturday.  And Friday night is Tim's big bachelor party!  Yay!!!  Me and my other roomate, Danny, have been planning this thing out for the last couple of days.  It oughta be a blast!  Hopefully when everything gets settled down I'll be able to post a little more often, but until then, ciao!  ~ <a href="mailto:webmaster@dark-autumn.com"> greenshady</a>
