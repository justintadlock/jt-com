I just had to make a quick post for whatever people that actually visit this site.  I will be out of town for a few days and will not be posting.  Sorry I didn't get the next chapter of the novel put up.  I had the Iron Bowl this weekend, then I went to the Supper Club afterwards.  I know, that's not the whole weekend, but it's part of it.  I would love to post more about the weekend, but I'm in a bit of a rush.  Expect lots of reading material when I return.

If I happen to gain internet access sometime when I'm home I'll try to post up some of my work.  So, have a happy Thanksgiving!
