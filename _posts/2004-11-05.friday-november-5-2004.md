TGIF!!! I sit here, four minutes into the new day, and breathe a fresh breath of air. Or whatever this stuff is that pollutes it. I didn't talk on the Presidential Campaign earlier this week. I guess it just slipped my mind. Bush Won! Yay! I've always been a Bush supporter. The top reason: Our troops support him. If your country's military doesn't support the President, then you shouldn't, especially in a time like this. So many people think he's a bad President because our troops are out in other countries, Iraq mostly, for such long periods. But, for the most part, they're not disagreeing with what the President is doing. So, he gets my vote for that one simple reason. Now, don't get me wrong, Kerry had a decent campaign, and I agree with a lot of his views. He just spent way too much time bashing Bush instead of addressing the topics that needed to be addressed. That's what lost him his election. Either way, I've always believed that it doesn't really matter who sits at the Oval Office. They'll perform well enough. Plus, they don't really have the power, not even most of it. It's the other guys that make most of the big decisions. Everything the President does can be overriden by someone else.

Well, I don't want to stay on politics that much, I'm not much for them. I just figured that I'd throw my two cents in, here on my little corner of the web. So, what happened to me today? Not much more than the norm. Went to school. Went to work. Been on the web ever since (aside from bathroom & food breaks). I'm also going home tomorrow. I'll be without web access all weekend. So, I won't be blogging until Sunday. Or maybe later this afternoon, after I get some sleep and go to class...

<em>Updates</em>...New guestbook. That was actually created late, late last night, then added tonight. I put up some new artwork (just one piece). I added new list bullets, with images, last night also. I love the Roswell skin ones. They're little handprints. Everyone should definitely check out that skin. I think I've worked out most of the kinks with all the links. If you notice anything wrong, just let me know in the contact section. Which, by the way, has a form now. So, you don't have to email me. Just fill out the form for contacts now. Hopefully, soon, I'll add an affiliates/link exchanges page, and put up some buttons/banners/images to link back to me. And maybe, <b> maybe</b> by tomorrow, I'll have a new skin ready. I want to do an <i> Angel</i> one. I just haven't decided how I want it to look just yet. I think that's about it. Don't forget to check out the new <a href="http://www.dark-autumn.com/skins/style.php?set=2" title="Roswell Skin"> Roswell Skin</a>...
