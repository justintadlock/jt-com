Yes, I've been a bit lazy about posting lately, but with some justification.  School has left me tired and delirious most of the time.  I haven't had much time for anything else.  A lot has been going on.  But, mostly my days consist of: school, work, study (with an added episode of television on DVD here and there), sleep.  Occasionally I get in the essential shower and food intake.  Hopefully, I'll have the time this weekend to spare myself the luxury of a few extra minutes to fully update this little blog area and shed some light (for the world or my few readers) on the happenings in the life of Justin Tadlock in the past month or so.
