I should start off like I do almost every day.  <i> I'm up past my bedtime, because I somehow cannot make myself get underneath the covers at a decent hour.</i>  There, that's out of the way.

I have came a long way in reconstructing all of my <a href="/skins" title="Skins Directory"> skins</a>.  In two days, I have fixed 6 different <a href="/skins" title="Skins Directory"> skins</a>.   Well, the first 2 only needed a little tweaking.  But, the other 4 needed a full-blown operation (for lack of a better phrase).  Now I have 7 <a href="/skins" title="Skins Directory"> skins</a> that work with <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie" title="IE Website" rel="external"> Internet Explorer</a>, <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox" title="Firefox Website" rel="external"> Firefox</a>, and <a href="http://browser.netscape.com" title="Netscape Website" rel="external"> Netscape</a>; and all the site is 100% <a href="http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=referer" title="Check The Validity Of This Site's XHTML" rel="external">Valid XHTML</a>.  Here is a list of the <del> seven</del> <ins datetime="2005-12-16T20:01:4806:00"> eight</ins> working <a href="/skins" title="Skins Directory"> skins</a>.

<ul>
<li><a href="/skins/style.php?set=18" title="Christmas Skin">Christmas</a></li>
<li><a href="/skins/style.php?set=17" title="Dark Stream">Dark Stream</a></li>
<li><a href="/skins/style.php?set=16" title="Summertime Skin">Summertime</a></li>
<li><a href="/skins/style.php?set=15" title="Yahoo Look-Alike Skin">Yahoo Look-Alike</a></li>
<li><a href="/skins/style.php?set=14" title="Sophia Bush Skin">Sophia Bush</a></li>
<li><a href="/skins/style.php?set=13" title="Soul Purpose Skin">Soul Purpose</a></li>
<li><a href="/skins/style.php?set=12" title="Amanda Bynes Skin">Amanda Bynes</a></li>
<li><a href="/skins/style.php?set=11" title="Alyson Michalka 2 Skin">Alyson Michalka 2</a></li>
</ul>

If there are any problems with any of these please <a href="/domain/contact.php" title="Contact Me"> Contact Me</a>.  There's been a lot of coding in the last 2 days (and still more to come), and the likelihood of errors is greater, even if I have been very careful.  Most of the errors would probably be CSS related.

Anyways, I'm off to bed, like always.  I have to be ready to make a yard beautiful for Mrs. Canon (or is it Ms., her husband is dead, is she still a Mrs.?).  Either way, I have some cleaning up to do there.  And I promise, for you people who like to read boring school-related posts, I will give a review of my classes and teachers sometime this week.  Even though my promises usually aren't worth much, especially when talking about blogging.
