I've been working on this idea in my head for some time.  I wasn't really sure how I was going to make my <a href="http://myspace.com/justintadlock" title="My MySpace Profile" rel="external"> MySpace profile</a> look like <a href="http://facebook.com" title="Facebook"> Facebook</a>.  However, I did remember reading Mike Davidson's <a href="http://www.mikeindustries.com/blog/archive/2006/04/hacking-myspace-layouts" title="Hacking A More Tasteful MySpace" rel="external"> Hacking A More Tasteful MySpace</a> a while back.  So, I snatched that code to work with.

So, now we're going to make our MySpace profiles look like our Facebook profiles.  Why would anyone want to do that?  Because Facebook just looks a lot more user-friendly.  And, it is more user-friendly.  Even though there's little we can do to make the MySpace interface work better, we can make it look better.  Since I'm so happy with Facebook's service, I've decided to dedicate this theme to them.

I won't bother going through an entire tutorial on how to tweak this thing.  You can find that at <a href="http://www.mikeindustries.com/blog/archive/2006/04/hacking-myspace-layouts" title="Hacking A More Tasteful MySpace" rel="external"> Hacking A More Tasteful MySpace</a>.  I would simply be saying the same thing Mike said.

I've obviously made a few adjustments to line things up a little differently, and I've put together some new images for the theme.  I'm still tweaking the layout to work better with <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox" title="Download Firefox Browser" rel="external"> Firefox</a>.  However, if you fix it before I do, then I would appreciate it if you send the code to me (I'm sure there'll be a link back if you do).

Feel free to modify the layout and images in any way you want.  Just "unzip" the contents of the file onto your computer.  Tweak the included "<code>.psd</code>" files in Photoshop.  Upload the images to your webserver.  Then, chage the image file paths in the included "<code>facebook-mimic.css</code>" file, and put it in the "About Me" section under "Edit Profile" in your MySpace control panel.

If you have any questions or suggestions, leave them here, and I'll try to get back to you or implement them as quickly as I can.

If you just want to trash me for making my profile look like Facebook, then feel free to do that here also.
