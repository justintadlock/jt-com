One more useless day down the drain.  And Blah Blah, Woof Woof!  Just a little throwback to <i> Dark Angel</i>.  Okay, I'm losing my readers already.  I put together a rough, and when I say rough I mean something like chicken scratch on sticky notes kind of rough, draft of my Report from the Field for Advanced Composition.  Ah, school talk already.

Useless day.
Down the drain.
Blah Blah, Woof Woof!

I'm going on a Six Flags trip this weekend!  Another Blah Blah, Woof Woof!  And yadda...yadda...yadda...

Nothing else is really going on outside of school.  I've been overly busy with the crap.

Useless Day.
Down the drain.
Blah Blah, Woof Woof!

I mean...I've been reading 3 books at a time.  Wait, add my extracurricular reading of, no-I'm-still-not-finished-with-it-yet <i> A Tribe Apart:  A Journey Into The Heart Of American Adolescence</i>, and that makes 4 books concurrently.  Then, I'm working on a paper for Advanced Composition and drawing up ideas for The Gothic paper that's due next week.  Oh yeah, I'm also trying to get ready for Spring 2006 registration, going through course descriptions, time blocks, and waiting lists.  I think I have a right to call it crap.  It gets a bit overbearing.

Useless Day.
Down the drain.
Blah Blah, Woof Woof!

I'm in serious need of a solid 8 hours of sleep.  No, make that at least 12 hours.  I won't get that tonight though.  Six hours, tops.  That's if I stop this blog right now and...
