Bored Now...  I've been watching <i> Buffy: Season 1</i> with my sister and Jamie.  In which, Amy(sister), skipped like just about every episode.  Anyways, I've made my <a href="me/class_schedule_fall04.html" title="Link No Longer Works" rel="external"><del> Daily Schedule</del></a> web page for this fall semester.  Just in case anyone was interested in what I do with my days.  Okay.  Bored Again.  I guess I'll come again, maybe when I'm not so bored.  ~ <a href="mailto:webmaster@dark-autumn.com"> greenshady</a>
