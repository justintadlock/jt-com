There's a new page on my site dedicated to the <em>Pro WP Plugin Development</em> book.  <a href="http://justintadlock.com/plugindevbook" title="Justin Tadlock: Professional WordPress Plugin Development">Check it out</a> and let me know what you think.  By the way, the page uses a couple of neat features available in <a href="http://themehybrid.com" title="Theme Hybrid">Theme Hybrid</a> themes (more on this later).
