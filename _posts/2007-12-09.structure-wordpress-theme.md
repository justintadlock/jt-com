<h3>Thoughts:</h3>

There are some things I wanted to do with this theme that I did do and others that I didn't.  Mostly, I think it turned out all right.  One thing I didn't get around to was putting together a "Theme Options" page for the WordPress dashboard.  This is something I definitely want to do in a future release.  It would make it much easier to customize.

Another thing I wanted to do was create a theme that was better than <a href="update-link" title="Visionary: WordPress theme for magazine and news sites"> Visionary</a>.  I had a lot of issues (personal) with that theme.  I fixed many of those with the Structure theme.

The layout is set on an imaginary 3-column grid, with each grid around 300px wide.  The reason I done this was so that a user could take different blocks of content and move them from the sidebar, to the bottom of the home page, and vice versa.  There's a lot of things you can play around with, and even add some of your own content in a custom content block.  I originally had this idea with Visionary, but couldn't really implement it in the way I wanted because of the size of the sidebar.  That's why you'll notice that the video option is different.

You'll definitely see the similarities in the two themes, but this one has much more potential for customization.  I think it looks a bit cleaner too.  Plus, I wanted to do something in blue.  I've worked on this theme for the past month, but didn't figure out what I wanted to do with it until last week.  Since then, I've been working non-stop.

There's more jQuery in the theme, and this could potentially be a bad thing for bloggers with a lot of users on slower connections because the jQuery is used to hide tabs.  Under these tabs is a lot of information.  This could take a little longer to load.

I'm sure there are a gazillion bugs that I need to fix, and I'll get around to them at some point.  This first week or so for the theme release is a debugging week.  There are so many different options that it would be too hard and take too long to test them all myself.

Now, I'm going to bed.  Feel free to report your bugs, complaints, and/or praise in the comments section below.  Also, <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/justintadlock" title="Subscribe to the feed"> subscribe to the feed</a> to be updated when new content comes out.
