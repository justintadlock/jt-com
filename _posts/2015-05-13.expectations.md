At this point, I suppose I shouldn't be surprised how much hostility and disinformation can be spread by one or two people in the WordPress community.  I've seen too much of it over the years to expect anything different.  It probably shouldn't surprise me that some people continue to give them an open platform to construct lies and twist truths.  I expected better.  I expect better.
