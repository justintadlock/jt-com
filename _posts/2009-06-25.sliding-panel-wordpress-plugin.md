Ever since I <a href="http://themehybrid.com/archives/2009/04/theme-hybrids-new-look" title="Theme Hybrid's new look">redesigned Theme Hybrid</a> back in April, I've gotten numerous requests for the code so that others could do something similar.

Typically, I'd point people to the Web Kreation article on <a href="http://web-kreation.com/index.php/wordpress/implement-a-nice-clean-jquery-sliding-panel-in-wordpress-27/" title="Creating a jQuery sliding panel in WordPress">integrating a sliding panel into WordPress</a>.  Unfortunately, this proved to be a tough task for the average end user.  Not to say anything bad about the great tutorial, but there are some problems with integrating it cleanly with WordPress.  Without the ideas generated there, we wouldn't have this plugin.

So, I decided to build a sliding panel from the ground up.  I wanted something that would be easy for the average end user to implement.  This plugin is a jQuery-based, fully-widgetized sliding panel for use on your WordPress-powered site.

<h2>What is a sliding panel?</h2>

Quite simply, it is a panel that can be opened and closed with a click of a mouse that will allow you to house additional content on your site without it getting in the way.

Here's a view of it in its closed (normal) state:

</figure>

Once a reader clicks on the <em>Open</em> button, the panel slides down the page, showing the content of the panel:

	<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Sliding panel in its open state</figcaption>
</figure>

<h2>What does the plugin do?</h2>

<em>Sliding Panel</em> comes with some neat features:

<ul>
	<li>Uses widgets, so you can add any content to the panel you want.</li>
	<li>Makes use of the jQuery packaged with WordPress to avoid plugin conflicts.</li>
	<li>Auto-inserts itself into a few themes:
		<ul>
		<li><a href="http://themehybrid.com/themes/hybrid" title="Hybrid WordPress theme framework">Hybrid</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://themeshaper.com/thematic" title="Thematic WordPress theme">Thematic</a></li>
		<li>Prodigy (not yet released)</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Provides the <code>get_sliding_panel()</code> template tag for use in other themes.</li>
</ul>
