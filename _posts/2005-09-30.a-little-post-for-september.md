It's been a long few weeks.
And let me emphasize <b> LONG</b>.
Two weeks ago I had 2 papers and a presentation. (Although the presentation wasn't graded)
The next week I had 2 more papers due.
And now, just Wednesday, I had a wisdom tooth cut out (stitches are to be taken out next Wednesday) and 2 pulled out.
I don't even want to get into it.

I just figured I'd post a little something in my blog area here, since I rarely get the time to do it.  For my Advanced Composition class I'm writing an ethnography.  So, all you avid readers (not that I have any), you can check out the progress here: <a href="http://literacy.dark-autumn.com"> Literacy Project</a>.  I'll try to keep it updated.  Another word that needs emphasized: <b> TRY</b>.

Well, I'm off to bed.  I've got a big test in Modern Drama tomorrow.

So, until next time...
