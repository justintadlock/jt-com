As I mentioned in the [previous post](http://justintadlock.com/archives/2018/10/04/the-college-era-then-and-now "The college era: Then and now"), I'm overhauling the blog.  This has given me the opportunity to reevaluate many things in my life.  I've been able to sit and remember some of the great things that have happened to me.  I've seen myself grow in these past 15 years of blogging.

What I regret the most is that I didn't write enough about my life.

During my college years, I wrote extensively about my day-to-day existence.  There were numerous experiences that I left out.

The first person to [buy something](http://justintadlock.com/archives/2005/12/15/someone-bought-something-from-my-wish-list) from my Amazon Wish List is someone I'd like to thank.  While I wrote about the experience of getting the gift, it's the future experiences that mattered.  That gift was the film "Serendipity."  It was my version of "The Notebook."  Literally every guy reading this knows what I'm talking about.  It's the ultimate date-night movie.  Let's just say that I've gotten all of somebody's $10 worth out of that film.

My blog painted a picture of who I was.

Even my 14 months in [South Korea](http://justintadlock.com/topics/south-korea) got a few posts.  I wish I'd spent more time writing about my experience there.  Granted, I had to be careful about divulging too much information online as a school teacher.

Toward the end of my stint teaching in Korea until present day, I've primarily focused on WordPress.  It has been my life for 10 years.  It hasn't been my entire life, but most wouldn't realize that simply reading through the posts of the past decade.

As I read through what is now nearly 800 posts, the ones that stand out the most are those that are about [my life](https://justintadlock.com/topics/life).  Most of the posts I wrote about some gizmo or gadget for WordPress 8 or 9 years ago don't bring back fond memories.  Those posts don't tell me about myself.  My first day of the [Body-For-Life challenge](http://justintadlock.com/archives/2005/07/11/day-1-body-for-life) or the time I [attempted NaNoWriMo](http://justintadlock.com/archives/2005/10/30/1666666666666666667-words-a-day) (National Novel Writing Month), are the moments that I look back on and appreciate.

Going forward, I want to record more about me.  Or, at the very least, record my thoughts on things.  That may include writings on social issues, politics, or pop culture.  I'm not entirely sure.

What I do know is that I want to look back on my life years from now and see a person who was passionate about things outside of work.
