Just updating a bit.  I found a video that seemed interesting.  It's Pamela Anderson supporting <acronym title="People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals"> PETA</acronym>.  Now, right off, I thought this would be stupid, but I watched it anyway.  It really paints a picture of what <acronym title="Kentucky Fried Chicken"> KFC</acronym> is doing to their chickens.  Now, I'm no animal rights activist or anything of the sort, but this just seems cruel. And sure, this is only one side of it, and video can be made to look worse than what it really is.  But, in this case, I just think that this is too cruel.  It's amazing what happens in this world that we don't even know about.
