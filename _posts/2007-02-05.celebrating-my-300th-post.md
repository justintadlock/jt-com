Today is a very special day in this site's history.  It is my 300th blog post.

One might be led to ask, "Why is 300 so special?"

Okay, it's nothing great, really.  I've just been counting the posts until I reached this point.  A couple of months ago, I realized I had quite a few posts, and I told myself I was going to celebrate when I hit 300.  That's pretty much the whole reasoning behind this.  Plus, I was mad at myself for not posting on my one-year anniversary of using <a href="http://wordpress.org" title="Wordpress" rel="external"> Wordpress</a> last May.  So, I had to make up some kind of blogging milestone to hit.

Here's some other moments in this site's blogging history:

<ul>
<li>First Wordpress post: <a href="/archives/2005/05/13/still-finding-style" title="Still Finding Style"> May 13, 2005: Still Finding Style</a></li>
<li>First blog at Dark-Autumn.com (now JustinTadlock.com): <a href="/archives/2004/04/12/monday-april-12-2oo4" title="April 12, 2004"> Monday, April 12, 2004</a></li>
<li>First blog post (pre-Wordpress, pre-real site): <a href="/archives/2003/04/15/welcome-to-my-site" title="Welcome To My Site"> April 15, 2003: Welcome To My Site</a></li>
</ul>

Feel free to browse the <a href="/archives" title="Blog Archives"> archives</a> to see what all I've blogged about in the last few years.  However, I must warn you to not go too far back.  Some of those posts are scary, even to me.
