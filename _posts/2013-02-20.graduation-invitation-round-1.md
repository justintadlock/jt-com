excerpt   : "A quick gallery of the first rough draft of my brother's high school graduation invitations."
---

I somehow managed to hire myself out for free to design my brother's high school graduation invitations.  Of course, he forgot to mention the deadline for getting his actual invitations through the school to anyone.  So, it was either spend $100s or get someone to do it for free.

I haven't done any print work since college, but I figured this might be a neat project.  He opted for a fun, "high school" look rather than classy and elegant, so that's what this design idea is based on.

The following are quick rough drafts of what I have in mind.  Ignore the photo (I'm getting a better one) and the extremely rough spacing.
