If you follow this blog, you know how much I love the taxonomy system in WordPress.  You especially know how much I love the new automated taxonomy system in version 2.8 of WordPress.

So, it only seems right that I introduce my first taxonomy-based plugin: <em>Series</em>.

<em>Series</em> allows you to string together posts by using the built-in taxonomy system in WordPress.  I've packaged several extra goodies with this plugin such as widgets, shortcodes, and template tags to allow you to easily control how display data on your blog.

Right now, the plugin is still in its early stages, but I hope with the help of your ideas and feedback, it'll become even greater.

<h2>Features of the Series plugin</h2>

<em>Series</em> extends the current taxonomy system by creating a new taxonomy called "series."  Here's the current feature list:

<ul>
	<li><strong>Series: List Posts widget</strong>
	Allows you to lists posts from a specific series and order them how you like.</li>
	<li><strong>Series: Related Posts widget</strong>
	Lists posts related to the current post on single-post views (not displayed otherwise).</li>
	<li><strong>Shortcodes</strong>
	Shortcodes to use within the post editor to display series-related things.</li>
	<li><strong>Template tags</strong>
	Template tags to show things like a series <acronym title="Really Simple Syndication">RSS</acronym> feed and to check whether a post is within a given series (and more, of course).</li>
	<li><strong>Automation</strong>
	Much of the process is completely automated using WordPress 2.8's new taxonomy system.</li>
	<li><strong>taxonomy-series.php templates</strong>
	Example series archive templates for use with the WordPress Default theme and the <a href="http://themehybrid.com/themes/hybrid" title="Hybrid WordPress theme framework">Hybrid theme</a>.</li>
</ul>

Here's a screenshot of the available widgets for use:

<h2>Download the Series plugin</h2>

This plugin will only work with <strong>WordPress 2.8+</strong>.  If you're using an older version, you'll have to wait until you've updated.  I just wanted to go ahead and get the initial release out.
