It only took two days for me to start wandering around like a zombie.  At 3,393 words, I'm barely out of the gates.

I knew today was going to be rough.  The 2nd day of a 30-day challenge and it just so happened to be "shopping" day.  I knew this beforehand.  I knew I needed to buy groceries, cat food, and enough chicken feed to last a bit.

I'd prepared for this.  I'd made a list of things to get me through at least another 2-3 weeks so that I didn't have to waste precious time later in the month resupplying.

Yet, I overslept.

I rarely oversleep.  I have cats who generally see that I'm up before the sun peaks above the pine trees in the morning.  My "wake the fuck up" alarm, which I keep set for 7:30 a.m., was blaring.

Not a good way to start the day.

I lose a contact lens.  I had one left to spare.  I need to set an eye appointment at some point to re-up my prescription.

I didn't sit down for my writing session until 1 p.m.  I've never been a great afternoon, evening, or night writer.  I do my best work early in the day, a few hours after I've allowed my body to slowly and naturally wake up.

But, I managed to haphazardly put words to screen, attempting to mine some gold from the long lost memories of my teen years as I jotted down prose of lust, love, and rebellion.  _Had I forgotten all I'd known?  How can I describe those experiences?_

Tomorrow, I should push beyond the 5,000-word mark and earn a new [NaNoWriMo](https://nanowrimo.org/) writing badge.

Maybe the weekend will be kind.
