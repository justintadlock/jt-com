I'm going to visit the folks today.  So, I won't be around to celebrate my one year <a href="http://www.wordpress.org" title="Wordpress Website" rel="external"> Wordpress</a> anniversary that started with <a href="/wordpress/index.php/2005/05/13/still-finding-style" title="My First Wordpress Post: Still Finding Style"> Still Finding Style</a> way back on May 13, 2005.  Oh well, maybe I can celebrate it when I get back on Monday.

Until then, enjoy the site.  Look around and stuff.  If you're here, I'm sure you have nothing better to do.
