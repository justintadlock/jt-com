I just got through watching <i> Smallville</i>. Of course, I can't miss an episode. Today's been a lazy day for me, so I worked a lot on the website. Check below for updates. I've got to get to work on some actual schoolwork sometime soon. Probably not tonight, but sometime in the near future, before I get bogged down all at once. I haven't even bothered looking at what my new Java program is supposed to be like for next week. It could be pretty tough. Anyways, not much else going on in my life today.

<b>New Roswell Skin</b> <a href="http://www.dark-autumn.com/skins/style.php?set=2" title="Select The Roswell Skin">Try it on!</a>

<em>Updates</em>...New skin, of course. I now offer just the two. The <a href="http://forum.dark-autumn.com" title="Dark Autumn Forum" rel="external"> Forum</a> is continously being worked on. So go sign up and become a user. I'm working on some skins to match the site. That'll take me a while, since I'm not that advanced with PHP just yet. I'm also working on a calendar to put up on the index page. Maybe I'll have it up sometime in the very near future. Not much else, for the moment. The guestbook and the Highland pages won't match everything exactly right now, but I'm working on doing something different with them. So just give me some time. Alrighty then...I'm off to work on the site a little more. I'll be back to talk about more useless things tomorrow...
