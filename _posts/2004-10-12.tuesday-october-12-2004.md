Here I am, once again.  Still updating the website.  I missed two classes this morning.  I just woke up and didn't feel very well at all.  I think I may be coming down with something.  So, I thought best to stay inside this morning.  Of course, I'm still going to work, in which I'll have to leave in like 15 minutes.  Though, I am feeling a little better, after sitting around this morning...

Website news...I've added a new <a href="/literature" title="Now Called The Literature Section"> Writings</a> section.  I've only put one story in it so far.  But hey, I'm only one man.  I can only do so much at a time.  I also added the uncompleted <i> Pilot</i> script to the <a href="http://www.dark-autumn.com/films/a/APieceOfMyEternalLife" title="Link Goes To A Piece Of My Eternal Life Now"> Pre-Production</a> section.  Don't read it, if you don't want to ruin seeing the film when I release it.  But, I would like some feedback on it.  I've also worked a little bit on the script this morning, which isn't posted there.  So, it will be updated within the next few days.  I'm still working on the overall css of the website.  Though, I don't think I'll add too much more.  I'm basically just organizing everything.  Making everything a little more simple for me to understand and use.  Anyways, there's your updates, and I hope to hear from you...
