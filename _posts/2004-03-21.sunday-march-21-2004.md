Well...I tried to blog earlier, but pop-ups were starting to tick me off.  I usually don't get that many.  But for some reason, they just wouldn't stop.  So I had to restart my computer.  Then I rode to Wal-Mart and bought some groceries.  And the 5th season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  And I've already watched two episodes now.  I had to make myself stop.  Okay!

Anyways, my sister won her beauty pageant Friday night.  And got the talent award also.  She sung 'Amazing Grace,' and my Dad played the piano for her.  It was pretty good.  But I had fun going home this weekend.  I thought about getting online and blogging yesterday while I was at my parents house.  Then I thought I would go crazy with a 56K modem.  So I opted to wait until tonight.  I may go back down next weekend, since my Spring Break will start on Friday.  Well, I guess that's enough stupid info for people who might actually read this crap.  Oh YEAH!  Don't forget to nominate yourself in the <a href="/websitechoiceawards" title="Website Choice Awards" rel="externa"> Website Choice Awards</a>.  Okay, now that's it.  <em> ~greenshady</em>
