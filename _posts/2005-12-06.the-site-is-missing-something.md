What have we here?  The site is missing something?  Yes.  I'm trying to get this thing running faster.  I don't know what's going on.  I thought it might be my code.  I thought it might be Yahoo's webhosting service.  I couldn't figure it out.  I don't think it's the webhosting service because I've been working on a site design for <a href="http://laneandkent.com.foreverclois.com" title="Lane &amp; Kent Website (New Window)" rel="external"> Lane &amp; Kent</a> and my code runs very smooth in <a href="http://www.dark-autumn.com/practice/laneandkent/index002.php" title="Lane &amp; Kent Design"> The Design</a> I put together for the site.  So, I'm just going to have to restructure everything.  Every last bit of it, to figure out what's going on.  I may have to start from scratch.  Well, not totally from scratch, but start anew.  I'll figure it out.  I think part of the code that may be slowing down the load time is the style switcher that is called in my header, or it could be the code in my menu when I call for the wordpress files.

So, for now, the skins are out and the wordpress archives have been taken off of the menu.  It may take me some time to fix this, simply because I'm about to start finals, and I'll be very busy until next Tuesday.  Everything else on the site is working fine, and the code seems to be running smoother now.  Anyways, I'm off to bed.  I promise I'll leave a good blog one day, one that's not fretting over internal site design.
