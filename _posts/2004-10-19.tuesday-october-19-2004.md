Once again...Not in bed on time.  But I'm working on getting there a little bit earlier each night.  The past day has been kind of rough. I spent 3 hours trying to figure out my Java programs I had to finish, and just couldn't do it. So, I totally screwed that up. Well, lucky for me, we have new projects due every week. So my grade won't be drastically hurt. After that, I finished off the rough draft of the movie script. Not much else going on though. Most of the night I spent my time finding free music to use, possibly for <i> Highland</i>. I actually found a great website. <a href="http://freeplaymusic.com" title="Free Play Music Website" rel="external"> Free Play Music</a> has some great stuff. And possibly some things I may be able to use. Anyways, I should finish up this little blog...Until next time...

<em>Highland Updates...</em>The finished rough draft of the script should be up within a day or so. For now, I posted up a 2nd unfinished rough draft in the pre-production section. Well...I think that's about it.
