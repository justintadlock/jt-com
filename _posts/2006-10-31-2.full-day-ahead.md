Okay, I am moving myself along this week slowly, my body dragging my lagging brain along inch by inch throughout the day.  And it's already Tuesday night.

Tomorrow, I have to meet with my Techonology, Literacy, &amp; Culture group to work on our video project, read Chapter 3 of <i> The Singularity is Near</i> and post twice on the WebCT discussion board about it, write a rough draft of a short story for Fiction Writing I, and start on my new <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org" title="National Novel Writing Month Website" rel="external"> NaNoWriMo</a> novel.  Yes, that's a full day's work alone; and I can't even start on it until after I get off work at 3 p.m. tomorrow.

Now, I must get some sleep.  Tomorrow's a big day.
