Okay...Okay...I know I said last night that I would be back later to blog.  Well...That didn't happen.  I got really, really tired, and went to bed at like 9:3o.  Anyways, I've been working on a new layout for when I get to version 8.o.  You can view it <a href="/art/images/DarkAutumn80.jpg" title="Mario Sunshine Layout" rel="external"> HERE</a>.  I also put some more pictures up in the <a href="http://" title="Link No Longer Works"><del> PICTURES GALLERY</del></a> today.  So go check those out.  And PEOPLE!  Start signing up for the <a href="/websitechoiceawards" title="Website Choice Awards" rel="external"> WEBSITE CHOICE AWARDS</a>!  Go now!  Before you do anything else!  Well...Whatever...I'll definitely, without a doubt, be back later to finish up this useless crap.  <em> ~greenshady</em>
