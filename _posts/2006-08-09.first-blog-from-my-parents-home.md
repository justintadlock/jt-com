Hey, I'm actually blogging from my parents' house.  How cool is that?  Four years ago they couldn't manage to get a computer in the house for their bright young high school graduate.  Now, they have, not only a computer and internet, but wireless.  The world has changed a bit in the last few years. And sometimes, just sometimes, I'm wondering, "Where was I?"

I mean, people from Highland Home, AL (my home, where I really come from), are even <a href="http://www.myspace.com" title="MySpace" rel="external"> MySpace</a> crazy.  And these are back-woods kind of people.  Of course, my Granny and Papa will probably never update to call-waiting, but they do own a DVD player.

Anyway, a program I was installing just got finished, and I have to restart my computer.  So, until, you know the drill...
