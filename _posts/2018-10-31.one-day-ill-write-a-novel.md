As I struggled to write my [About page](http://justintadlock.com/about) a few days ago, I realized that I've always had one unchanging goal in life.  This is a goal that I've had since I was a schoolboy.  It hit me that I'm not any closer to achieving this goal than I was 10 or 15 years ago.  I didn't want to update that page with the same unaccomplished goal and have it sitting there for more years to come.

_One day, I'll write a novel._

Like many things that I thought I would have accomplished by now, "life" has gotten in the way.  _There's always something else to do.  I'm too tired after work.  I've got an errand to run.  I've got dinner to cook._

Thirteen years ago, I [attempted to write a novel](http://justintadlock.com/archives/2005/10/30/1666666666666666667-words-a-day) in one month following the [National Novel Writing Month](https://nanowrimo.org/) (NaNoWriMo) challenge.  This was arguably the busiest time of my life.  I was taking several writing and literature courses, working two jobs, and trying to keep pace with all my party-going college friends.  To make matters worse, I had to prep for semester finals and spend time with family for Thanksgiving.  The most insane thing I could add to my schedule was attempting to write a novel within a month.

However, I still knocked out around 25,000 words of the 50,000-word goal before the month was out.

Today, I can't say that I have the same excuses.  Yes, I run my own business.  Yes, paying bills and taxes is stressful.  Yes, there's a whole slew of other _excuses_ that accompany adulthood.  But, I'll never be as busy as I was in college.  I'm just a bit lazier and more stressed out with "adult" stuff.

What I've found to be the greatest motivator through my 30-something years is that nothing beats a good deadline.  When I was writing [Professional WordPress Plugin Development](http://justintadlock.com/plugindevbook), I wouldn't have finished a single chapter without a deadline (my co-authors and I had two chapters each per month).  Having an editor awaiting an email with your chapters and an advance of a few 1,000 dollars helps, but deadlines are where the magic happens.

That's why I've decided to hop on the NaNoWriMo train again this year.  It will provide me with a solid deadline for the month.

Shooting for 50,000 words also breaks down to roughly 1,667 words every day.  That's an easy goal for someone who tends to be as long-winded as I am.

_Some of you who have read my WordPress tutorials are now shaking your heads in agreement.  Justin, cut some of the talk out and just show me the code!_

I don't have any characters in mind.  I have no plot points scribbled on notepaper.  I'm starting from zero.  It's only today that I decided to take the plunge after a few days of questioning whether I was mentally prepared for such an undertaking.

I'll just write and see what happens.  One massive brain dump.

I tend to wing things anyway.  That's when I do some of my best work in any field.  I've written term papers in the hours prior to placing them in my professors' hands.  I've given presentations with only a couple of index cards worth of notes.  I've built fully-functioning WordPress plugins on the fly.  Perhaps my first novel should be no different.

I'm only posting this on my blog to make it a permanent goal that I'm not allowed to wiggle my way out of.  _If no one knows about it, is it really a goal?_

This should be a fun, stressful, insane month.  Let's see where it goes.  Feel free to [join the adventure](https://nanowrimo.org/ "National Novel Writing Month") if you dare.
