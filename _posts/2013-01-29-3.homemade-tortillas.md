I tried my hand at making some tortillas tonight.  My car battery died, which meant I couldn't drive to town to get any pre-packaged ones.  I had already made some bean/rice mix and guacamole on Sunday.  So, I just threw them on my first ever homemade tortillas.  They were not perfect, but they'll beat store-bought ones any day.
