The <em>Query Posts</em> WordPress widget is finally here.  I figured after I've let you all <a href="http://justintadlock.com/archives/2009/01/28/anybody-want-to-test-a-new-widget" title="Anybody want to test a new widget?">beta test</a> this thing for over a month, it was about time.

This widget has everything you'll ever need to show posts on your site without touching code.  It's like having a WordPress developer ready to do your bidding all wrapped up in a widget.  All you need is a theme that's widgetized, which I believe is pretty standard these days.

<h2>What does the Query Posts widget do?</h2>

It lets you displays posts by nearly any criteria you can imagine using the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags/query_posts" title="WordPress Codex: query_posts">query_posts()</a> function, except you don't need to know anything about <acronym title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</acronym> to use it.  You can do all kinds of neat things:

<ul>
	<li>Posts by tag.</li>
	<li>Posts by category.</li>
	<li>Posts by author.</li>
	<li>Posts by time/date.</li>
	<li>Posts by custom field key and/or value.</li>
	<li>Choose any number.</li>
	<li>Order by various terms.</li>
	<li>Show pages.</li>
	<li>Show the full post, excerpt, or even order them in a list.</li>
	<li>And much more...</li>
</ul>

Nearly 40 options are available in this widget, which you can use any number of times.  Just check out the screenshot:
